<h2>ACT I</h2>


<h3 class="smcap">Scene 1</h3>

<p class="scene">The scene represents the verandah of a fine country-house,
in front of which a croquet-lawn and tennis-court are shown,
also a flower-bed. The children are playing croquet with their
governess. Mary Iv&aacute;novna Sar&yacute;ntsova, a handsome elegant
woman of forty; her sister, Alex&aacute;ndra Iv&aacute;novna K&oacute;hovtseva,
a stupid, determined woman of forty-five; and her husband,
Peter Semy&oacute;novich <ins title="K&oacute;hovstsev">K&oacute;hovtsef</ins>, a fat flabby man, dressed in
a summer suit, with a pince-nez, are sitting on the verandah
at a table with a <ins title="samovar">samov&aacute;r</ins> and coffee-pot. Mary Iv&aacute;novna
Sar&yacute;ntsova, Alex&aacute;ndra Iv&aacute;novna K&oacute;hovtseva, and Peter
Semy&oacute;novich K&oacute;hovtsev are drinking coffee, and the latter
is smoking.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> If you were not my sister, but a
stranger, and Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich not your husband, but
merely an acquaintance, I should think all this very
original, and perhaps I might even encourage him,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J'aurais trouv&eacute; tout &ccedil;a tr&egrave;s gentil</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but when I see that
<em>your</em> husband is playing the fool&mdash;yes, simply playing
the fool&mdash;then I can't help telling you what I think about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326">326</a></span>it. And I shall tell your husband, Nicholas, too. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je lui
dirai son fait, ma ch&egrave;re.</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I am not afraid of anyone.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I don't feel the least bit hurt; don't I
see it all myself? but I don't think it so very important.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> No. You don't think so, but I
tell you that, if you let it go on, you will be beggared.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Du train que cela va&nbsp;&hellip;</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> Come! Beggared indeed! Not
with an income like theirs.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Yes, beggared! And please don't
interrupt me, my dear! Anything a <em>man</em> does always
seems right to you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> Oh! I don't know. I was
<span class="nowrap">saying&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But you never do know what you
are saying, because when you men begin playing the fool,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il n'y a pas de raison que &ccedil;a finisse</i>.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I am only saying that
if I were in your place, I should not allow it. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J'aurais
mis bon ordre &agrave; toutes ces lubies.</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> What does it all mean?
A husband, the head of a family, has no occupation,
abandons everything, gives everything away, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">et fait le
g&eacute;n&eacute;reux &agrave; droite et &agrave; gauche</i>.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> I know how it will end!
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nous en savons quelque chose.</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>to Mary Iv&aacute;novna</i>]. But do explain
to me, Mary, what is this new movement? Of course I
understand Liberalism, County Councils, the Constitution,
schools, reading-rooms, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ce qui s'en suit</i>;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> as well as
Socialism, strikes, and an eight-hour day; but what is
this? Explain it to me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But he told you about it yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327">327</a></span>
<span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> I confess I did not understand.
The Gospels, the Sermon on the Mount&mdash;and that
churches are unnecessary! But then how is one to pray,
and all that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Yes. That is the worst of it. He
would destroy everything, and give us nothing in its place.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> How did it begin?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> It began last year, after his sister died.
He was very fond of her, and her death had a very great
effect on him. He became quite morose, and was always
talking about death; and then, you know, he fell ill himself
with typhus. When he recovered, he was quite a
changed man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But, all the same, he came in
spring to see us again in Moscow, and was very nice, and
played bridge. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il &eacute;tait tr&egrave;s gentil et comme tout le monde.</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But, all the same, he was then quite
changed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> In what way?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> He was completely indifferent to his
family, and purely and simply had <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'id&eacute;e fixe</i>. He read
the Gospels for days on end, and did not sleep. He
used to get up at night to read, made notes and extracts,
and then began going to see bishops and hermits&mdash;consulting
them about religion.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> And did he fast, or prepare for
communion?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> From the time of our marriage&mdash;that's
twenty years ago&mdash;till then he had never fasted nor
taken the sacrament, but at that time he did once take the
sacrament in a monastery, and then immediately afterwards
decided that one should neither take communion nor go
to church.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> That's what I say&mdash;thoroughly
inconsistent!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328">328</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Yes, a month before, he would not
miss a single service, and kept every fast-day; and then
he suddenly decided that it was all unnecessary. What
can one do with such a man?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I have spoken and will speak to
him again.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> Yes! But the matter is of no
great importance.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> No? Not to you! Because you
men have no religion.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> Do let me speak. I say that that
is not the point. The point is this: if he denies the
Church, what does he want the Gospels for?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Well, so that we should live according
to the Gospels and the Sermon on the Mount, and give
everything away.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> But how is one to live if one gives
everything away?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> And where has he found in the
Sermon on the Mount that we must shake hands with
footmen? It says &ldquo;Blessed are the meek,&rdquo; but it says
nothing about shaking hands!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Yes, of course, he gets carried away, as
he always used to. At one time it was music, then
shooting, then the school. But that doesn't make it any
the easier for me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> Why has he gone to town to-day?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> He did not tell me, but I know it is
about some trees of ours that have been felled. The
peasants have been cutting trees in our wood.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> In the pine-tree plantation?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Yes, they will probably be sent to
prison and ordered to pay for the trees. Their case
was to be heard to-day, he told me of it, so I feel certain
that is what he has gone about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329">329</a></span>
<span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> He will pardon them, and to-morrow
they will come to take the trees in the park.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Yes, that is what it leads to. As it is,
they break our apple-trees and tread down the green
cornfields, and he forgives them everything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> Extraordinary!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> That is just why I say that it
must not be allowed to go on. Why, if it goes on like
that, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout y passera</i>.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> I think it is your duty as a mother
to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prendre tes <ins title="m&eacute;sures">mesures</ins></i>.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> What can I do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> What indeed! Stop him! Explain
to him that this cannot go on. You have your
children! What sort of an example is it for them?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Of course, it is hard; but I go on
bearing it, and hoping it will pass, like his former infatuations.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Yes, but &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Aide toi et Dieu
t'aidera!</i>&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> You must make him feel that he has not
only himself to think of, and that one can't live like that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> The worst of all is that he no longer
troubles about the children, and I have to decide everything
myself. I have an unweaned baby, besides the
older children: girls and boys, who have to be looked
after, and need guidance. And I have to do it all
single-handed. He used to be such an affectionate and
attentive father, but now he seems no longer to care.
Yesterday I told him that V&aacute;nya is not studying properly,
and will not pass his exam., and he replied that it would
be by far the best thing for him to leave school altogether.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> To go where?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Nowhere! That's the most terrible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330">330</a></span>thing about it; everything we do is wrong, but he does
not say what would be right.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> That's odd.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> What is there odd about it? It
is just <em>your</em> usual way. Condemn everything, and do
nothing yourself!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Sty&oacute;pa has now finished at the University,
and ought to choose a career; but his father says
nothing about it. He wanted to take a post in the Civil
Service, but Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich says he ought not to do
so. Then he thought of entering the Horse-Guards, but
Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich quite disapproved. Then the lad
asked his father: &ldquo;What am I to do then&mdash;not go and
plough after all?&rdquo; and Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich said: &ldquo;Why
not plough? It is much better than being in a Government
Office.&rdquo; So what was he to do? He comes to me
and asks, and I have to decide everything, and yet the
authority is all in his hands.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Well, you should tell him so
straight out.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> So I must! I shall have to talk to him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> And tell him straight out that
you can't go on like this. That you do your duty, and
he must do his; or if not&mdash;let him hand everything over
to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> It is all so unpleasant!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I will tell him, if you like. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je
lui dirai son fait.</i><a name="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><i>Enter a young priest, confused and agitated. He carries
a book, and shakes hands all round.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> I have come to see Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich. I
have, in fact, come to return a book.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> He has gone to town, but will be back
soon.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> What book are you returning?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331">331</a></span>
<span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Oh, it's Mr. Renan's <cite>Life of Jesus</cite>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> Dear me! What books you
read!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST</span> [<i>much agitated, lights a cigarette</i>] It was Nicholas
Iv&aacute;novich gave it to me to read.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA</span> [<i>contemptuously</i>] Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich
gave it you! And do you agree with Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich
and Mr. Renan?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> No, of course not. If I really did agree, I should
not, in fact, be what is called a servant of the Church.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But if you are, as it is called,
a faithful servant of the Church, why don't you convert
Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Everyone, in fact, has his own views on these
matters, and Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich really maintains much that
is quite true, only he goes astray, in fact, on the main
point, the Church.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA</span> [<i>contemptuously</i>] And what are the
many things that Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich maintains that are
quite true? Is it true that the Sermon on the Mount bids
us give our property away to strangers and let our own
families go begging?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> The Church, in fact, sanctions the family, and
the Holy Fathers of the Church, in fact, blessed the
family; but the highest perfection really demands the
renunciation of worldly advantages.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Of course the Anchorites acted
so, but ordinary mortals, I should imagine, should act in
an ordinary way, as befits all good Christians.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> No one can tell unto what he may be called.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> And, of course, you are married?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Oh yes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> And have you any children?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Two.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Then why don't you renounce
worldly advantages, and not go about smoking a cigarette?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332">332</a></span>
<span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Because of my weakness, in fact, my unworthiness.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Ah! I see that instead of bringing

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I'm coming, <ins title="coming?">coming!</ins> [<i>Rises and exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I'm dreadfully sorry for my sister.
I see how she suffers. Seven children, one of them
unweaned, and then all these fads to put up with. It
seems to me quite plain that he has something wrong
here [<i>touching her forehead. To Priest</i>] Now tell me,
I ask you, what new religion is this you have discovered?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> I don't understand, in fact&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Oh, please don't beat about the

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> But allow me&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I ask you, what creed is it that
bids us shake hands with every peasant and let them cut
down the trees, and give them money for <ins title="vodka">v&oacute;dka</ins>, and
abandon our own <ins title="families.">families?</ins></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> I don't know that&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> He says it is Christianity. You
are a priest of the Orthodox Greek Church, and therefore
you must know and must say whether Christianity bids
us encourage robbery.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> But I&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Or else, why are you a priest, and
why do you wear long hair and a cassock?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> But we are not asked&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Not asked, indeed! Why, I am
asking you! He told me yesterday that the Gospels say,
&ldquo;Give to him that asketh of thee.&rdquo; But then in what
sense is that meant?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333">333</a></span>
<span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> In its plain sense, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> And I think not in the plain sense;
we have always been taught that everybody's position is
appointed by God.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Of course, but yet&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Oh, yes. It's just as I was told;
you take his side, and that is wrong! I say so straight
out. If some young school teacher, or some young lad,
lickspittles to him, it's bad enough&mdash;but you, in your
position, should remember the responsibility that rests
on you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> I try to&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> What sort of religion is it, when
he does not go to church, and does not believe in the
sacraments? And instead of bringing him to his senses,
you read Renan with him, and interpret the Gospels in a
way of your own.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST</span> [<i>excitedly</i>] I cannot answer. I am, in fact,
upset, and will hold my tongue.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Oh! If only I were your Bishop;
I'd teach you to read Renan and smoke cigarettes.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Well, and what have you decided
on?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> I don't know what Papa has decided. I'm
afraid he does not quite know himself; but as for me, I
have decided to volunteer for the Horse-Guards. In our
house some special objection is made to every step that is
taken; but this is all quite simple. I have finished my
studies, and must serve my time. To enter a line
regiment and serve with tipsy low-class officers would be
unpleasant, and so I'm entering the Horse-Guards, where
I have friends.</p>

nothing but what he wants to see. He says military
service is the basest kind of employment, and that therefore
one should not serve, and so he won't give me any
money.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> No! Sty&oacute;pa. He did not say that! You know
I was present. He says that if you cannot avoid serving,
you should go when you are called; but that to volunteer,
is to choose that kind of service of your own free will.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> But it's I, not he, who is going to serve. He
himself was in the army!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> Yes, but he does not exactly say that he will not
give you the money; but that he cannot take part in an

this <ins title="samovar">samov&aacute;r</ins>.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Well, if you want me to tell you

and being totally ruined, because they cut down ten trees
in a forest which is considered to be mine&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Considered so by everybody.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> Oh dear! Disputing again.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Even if I considered that forest
mine, which I cannot do, we have 3000 acres of forest,
with about 150 trees to the acre. In all, about 450,000
trees&mdash;is that correct? Well, they have cut down ten
trees&mdash;that is, one 45-thousandth part. Now is it worth
while, and can one really decide, to tear a man away from
his family and put him in prison for that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> Ah! but if you don't hold on to this one 45-thousandth,
all the other <ins title="There are 449,990 trees remaining. This might either be a typesetting mistake or an error made by Styópa.">44,990</ins> trees will very soon be
cut down also.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> But I only said <em>that</em> in answer to
your aunt. In reality I have no right to this forest.
Land belongs to everyone; or rather, it can't belong to
anyone. We have never put any labour into this land.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> No, but you saved money and preserved this
forest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> How did I get my savings? What
enabled me to save up? And I didn't preserve the forest
myself! However, this is a matter which can't be proved
to anyone who does not himself feel ashamed when he
strikes at another man&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> But no one is striking anybody!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Just as when a man feels no
shame at taking toll from others' labour without doing
any work himself, you cannot prove to him that he
ought to be ashamed; and the object of all the Political
Economy you learnt at the University is merely to justify
the false position in which we live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341">341</a></span>
<span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> On the contrary; science destroys all prejudices.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> However, all this is of no importance
to me. What is important is that in Yef&iacute;m's<a name="FNanchor_24_24" href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> place
I should have acted as he did, and I should have been
desperate had I been imprisoned. And as I wish to do
to others as I wish them to do to me&mdash;I cannot condemn
him, but do what I can to save him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> But, if one goes on that line, one
cannot possess anything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>smiling</i>] I don't know which I am
to reply to. [<i>To Peter Semy&oacute;novich</i>] It's true. One
should not possess anything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But if one should not possess
anything, one can't have any clothes, nor even a crust of
bread, but must give away everything, so that it's impossible
to live.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> And it should be impossible to live
as we do!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> In other words, we must die! Therefore, that
teaching is unfit for life.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> No. It is given just that men
may live. Yes. One should give everything away.
Not only the forest we do not use and hardly ever see,
but even our clothes and our bread.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> What! And the children's too?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Yes, the children's too. And not
only our bread, but ourselves. Therein lies the whole
teaching of Christ. One must strive with one's whole
strength to give oneself away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342">342</a></span>
<span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> That means to die.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Yes, even if you gave your life for
your friends, that would be splendid both for you and for
others. But the fact is that man is not solely a spirit,
but a spirit within a body; and the flesh draws him to
live for itself, while the spirit of light draws him to
live for God and for others: and the life in each of us is
not solely animal, but is equipoised between the two. But
the more it is a life for God, the better; and the animal
will not fail to take care of itself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> Why choose a middle course: an equipoise
between the two? If it is right to do so&mdash;why not give
away everything and die?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> That would be splendid. Try to
do it, and it will be well both for you and for others.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> No, that is not clear, not simple.
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'est tir&eacute; par les cheveux.</i><a name="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Well, I can't help it, and it can't
be explained by argument. However, that is enough.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> Yes, quite enough, and I also don't understand
it. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>turns to Priest</i>] Well, what impression
did the book make on you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST</span> [<i>agitated</i>] How shall I put it? Well, the
historic part is insufficiently worked out, and it is not
fully convincing, or let us say, quite reliable; because the
materials are, as a matter of fact, insufficient. Neither the
Divinity of Christ, nor His lack of Divinity, can be proved
historically; there is but one <ins title="irrefragible">irrefragable</ins> proof.&hellip;</p>

<p><i>During this conversation first the ladies and then Peter
Semy&oacute;novich go out.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> You mean the Church?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Well, of course, the Church, and the evidence,
let's say, of reliable men&mdash;the Saints for instance.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Of course, it would be excellent if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343">343</a></span>there existed a set of infallible people to confide in.
It would be very desirable; but its desirability does not
prove that they exist!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> And I believe that just <em>that is</em> the proof. The
Lord could not in fact have exposed His law to the
possibility of mutilation or misinterpretation, but must in
fact have left a guardian of His truth to prevent that
truth being mutilated.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Very well; but we first tried to
prove the truth itself, and now we are trying to prove the
reliability of the guardian of the truth.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Well here, as a matter of fact, we require faith.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Faith&mdash;yes, we need faith. We
can't do without faith. Not, however, faith in what
other people tell us, but faith in what we arrive at
ourselves, by our own thought, our own reason &hellip;
faith in God, and in true and everlasting life.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Reason may deceive. Each of us has a different
mind.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>hotly</i>] There, that is the most
terrible blasphemy! God has given us just one sacred
tool for finding the truth&mdash;the only thing that can unite
us all, and we do not trust it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> How can we trust in it, when there are <ins title="contradictions.">contradictions?</ins></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Where are the contradictions?
That twice two are four; and that one should not do to
others what one would not like oneself; and that everything
has a cause? Truths of that kind we all acknowledge
because they accord with all our reason. But that God
appeared on Mount Sinai to Moses, or that Buddha flew
up on a sunbeam, or that Mahomet went up into the sky,
and that Christ flew there also&mdash;on matters of that kind
we are all at variance.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> No, we are not at variance, those of us who abide
in the truth are all united in one faith in God, Christ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344">344</a></span>
<span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> No, even there, you are not united,
but have all gone asunder; so why should I believe you
rather than I would believe a Buddhist Lama? Only
because I happened to be born in your faith?</p>

<p>[<i>The tennis players dispute</i>] &ldquo;Out!&rdquo; &ldquo;Not out!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">V&Aacute;NYA.</span> I saw it&nbsp;&hellip;:</p>

<p><i>During the conversation, men-servants set the table again for
tea and coffee.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> You say the Church unites. But, on
the contrary, the worst dissensions have always been
caused by the Church. &ldquo;How often would I have
gathered you as a hen gathers her chickens.&rdquo;&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> That was until Christ. But Christ did gather
them all together.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Yes, Christ united; but we have
divided: because we have understood him the wrong
way round. He destroyed all Churches.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Did he not say: &ldquo;Go, tell the Church.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> It is not a question of words!
Besides those words don't refer to what we call &ldquo;Church.&rdquo;
It is the spirit of the teaching that matters. Christ's
teaching is universal, and includes all religions, and does
not admit of anything exclusive; neither of the Resurrection
nor the Divinity of Christ, nor the Sacraments&mdash;nor
of anything that divides.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> That, as a matter of fact, if I may say so, is
your own interpretation of Christ's teaching. But
Christ's teaching is all founded on His Divinity and
Resurrection.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> That's what is so dreadful about
the Churches. They divide by declaring that they
possess the full indubitable and infallible truth. They
say: &ldquo;It has pleased us and the Holy Ghost.&rdquo; That began
at the time of the first Council of the Apostles. They
then began to maintain that they had the full and <em>exclusive</em>
truth. You see, if I say there is a God: the first cause
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345">345</a></span>of the Universe, everyone can agree with me; and <em>such</em>
an acknowledgment of God will unite us; but if I say
there is a God: Brahma, or Jehovah, or a Trinity, such
a God divides us. Men wish to unite, and to that end
devise all means of union, but neglect the one indubitable
means of union&mdash;the search for truth! It is as if people
in an enormous building, where the light from above
shone down into the centre, tried to unite in groups around
lamps in different corners, instead of going towards the
central light, where they would naturally all be united.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> And how are the people to be guided&mdash;without
any really definite truth?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> That's what is terrible! Each
<em>one</em> of us has to save <em>his own</em> soul, and has to do God's
work <em>himself</em>, but instead of that we busy ourselves saving
<em>other people</em> and teaching <em>them</em>. And what do we teach
them? We teach them now, at the end of the nineteenth
century, that God created the world in six days, then
caused a flood, and put all the animals in an ark, and all
the rest of the horrors and nonsense of the Old Testament.
And then that Christ ordered everyone to be baptized
with water; and we make them believe in all the absurdity
and meanness of an Atonement essential to salvation;
and then that he rose up into the heavens which do not
really exist, and there sat down at the right hand of the
Father. We have got used to all this, but really it is
dreadful! A child, fresh and ready to receive all that is
good and true, asks us what the world is, and what its
laws are; and we, instead of revealing to him the
teaching of love and truth that has been given to us,
carefully ram into his head all sorts of horrible absurdities
and meannesses, ascribing them all to God. Is that not
terrible? It is as great a crime as man can commit.
And we&mdash;you and your Church&mdash;do this! Forgive me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Yes, if one looks at Christ's teaching from a
rationalistic point of view, it is so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346">346</a></span>
<span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Whichever way one looks, it is so.

<p><i>Enter Alex&aacute;ndra Iv&aacute;novna. Priest bows to take his leave.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Good-bye, Father. He will lead
you astray. Don't you listen to him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> No. Search the Scriptures! The matter is
too important, as a matter of fact, to be&mdash;let's say&mdash;neglected.
[<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Really, Nicholas, you have no
pity on him! Though he is a priest, he is still only a boy,
and can have no firm convictions or settled views.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Give him time to settle down and
petrify in falsehood? No! Why should I? Besides, he
is a good, sincere man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But what will become of him if
he believes you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> He need not believe <em>me</em>. But if
he saw the truth, it would be well for him and for everybody.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> If it were really so good, everyone
would be ready to believe you. As it is, no one believes
you, and your wife least of all. She <em>can't</em> believe you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Who told you that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Well, just you try and explain it
to her! She will never understand, nor shall I, nor
anyone else in the world, that one must care for other
people and abandon one's own children. Go and try to
explain that to Mary!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Yes, and Mary will certainly
understand. Forgive me, Alex&aacute;ndra, but if it were not
for other people's influence, to which she is very susceptible,
she would understand me and go with me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> To beggar your children for the
sake of drunken Yef&iacute;m and his sort? Never! But if I
have made you angry, please forgive me. I can't help
speaking out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347">347</a></span>
<span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I am not angry. On the contrary,
I am even glad you have spoken out and given me
the opportunity&mdash;challenged me&mdash;to explain to Mary my
whole outlook on life. On my way home to-day I was
thinking of doing so, and I will speak to her at once; and
you will see that she will agree, because she is wise and
good.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Well, as to that, allow me to
have my doubts.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> But I have no doubts. For you
know, this is not any invention of my own; it is only
what we all of us know, and what Christ revealed to us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Yes, you think Christ revealed
this, but I think he revealed something else.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> It cannot be anything else.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">V&Aacute;NYA.</span> It's not true.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> For one thing, it's rude to say &ldquo;It's not true.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">V&Aacute;NYA.</span> And it's rude to say what is not true!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Just wait a bit, and don't argue,
but listen. Isn't it true that at any moment we may die,
and either cease to exist, or go to God who expects us
to live according to His will?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Well, what can I do in this life
other than what the supreme judge in my soul, my
conscience&mdash;God&mdash;requires of me? And my conscience&mdash;God&mdash;requires
that I should regard everybody as equal,
love everybody, serve everybody.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Your own children too?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Naturally, my own too, but obeying
all that my conscience demands. Above all, that I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348">348</a></span>should understand that my life does not belong to me&mdash;nor
yours to you&mdash;but to God, who sent us into the
world and who requires that we should do His will. And
His will is&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> And you think that you will
persuade Mary of this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> And that she will give up educating
the children properly, and will abandon them?
Never!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Not only will she understand, but
you too will understand that it is the only thing to do.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Never!</p>

<p><i>Enter Mary Iv&aacute;novna.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Well, Mary! I didn't wake you
this morning, did I?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> No, I was not asleep. And have you
had a successful day?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Yes, very.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Why, your coffee is quite cold! Why
do you drink it like that? By the way, we must prepare
for our visitors. You know the Cheremsh&aacute;novs are
coming?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Well, if you're glad to have them, I
shall be very pleased.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I like her and her children, but they
have chosen a rather inconvenient time for their visit.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA</span> [<i>rising</i>] Well, talk matters over
with him, and I'll go and watch the tennis.</p>

<p><i>A pause, then Mary Iv&aacute;novna and Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich begin
both talking at once.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> It's inconvenient, because we must
have a talk.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I was just saying to Aline&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> No, you speak first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349">349</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Well, I wanted to have a talk with you
about Sty&oacute;pa. After all, something <em>must</em> be decided.
He, poor fellow, feels depressed, and does not know what
awaits him. He came to me, but how can I decide?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Why decide? He can decide for
himself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But, you know, he wants to enter the
Horse-Guards as a volunteer, and in order to do that he
must get you to countersign his papers, and he must also
be in a position to keep himself; and you don't give him
anything. [<i>Gets excited</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Mary, for heaven's sake don't get
excited, but listen to me. I don't give or withhold
anything. To enter military service of one's own free
will, I consider either a stupid, insensate action, suitable
for a savage if the man does not understand the evil of
his action, or despicable if he does it from an interested
motive.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But nowadays everything seems savage
and stupid to you. After all, he must live; you lived!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>getting irritable</i>] I lived when I did
not understand; and when nobody gave me good advice.
However, it does not depend on me but on him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> How not on you? It's you who don't
give him an allowance.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I can't give what is not mine!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Not yours? What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> The labour of others does not
belong to me. To give him money, I must first take it
from others. I have no right to do that, and I cannot do
it! As long as I manage the estate I must manage it as
my conscience dictates; and I cannot give the fruits of
the toil of the overworked peasants to be spent on the
debaucheries of Life-Guardsmen. Take over my property,
and then I shall not be responsible!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> You know very well that I don't want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350">350</a></span>to take it, and moreover I can't. I have to bring up the
children, besides nursing them and bearing them. It is cruel!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Mary, dear one! That is not the
main thing. When you began to speak I too began and
wanted to talk to you quite frankly. We must not go on
like this. We are living together, but don't understand
one another. Sometimes we even seem to misunderstand
one another on purpose.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I want to understand, but I don't. No,
I don't understand you. I do not know what has come to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Well then, try and understand!
This may not be a convenient time, but heaven knows
when we shall find a convenient time. Understand not
me&mdash;but yourself: the meaning of your own life! We
can't go on living like this without knowing what we are
living for.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> We have lived so, and lived very
happily. [<i>Noticing a look of vexation on his face</i>] All right,
all right, I am listening.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Yes, I too lived so&mdash;that is to say,
without thinking why I lived; but a time came when I
was terror-struck. Well, here we are, living on other
people's labour&mdash;making others work for us&mdash;bringing
children into the world and bringing them up to do the
same. Old age will come, and death, and I shall ask
myself: &ldquo;Why have I lived?&rdquo; In order to breed more
parasites like myself? And, above all, we do not even
enjoy this life. It is only endurable, you know, while, like
V&aacute;nya, you overflow with life's energy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But everybody lives like that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> And they are all unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Not at all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Anyhow, I saw that I was terribly
unhappy, and that I made you and the children unhappy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351">351</a></span>and I asked myself: &ldquo;Is it possible that God created us
for this end?&rdquo; And as soon as I thought of it, I felt at
once that he had not. I asked myself: &ldquo;What, then, has
God created us for?&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Enter Man-servant.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA</span> [<i>Not listening to her husband, turns to
Servant</i>] Bring some boiled cream.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> And in the Gospels I found the
answer, that we certainly should not live for our own sake.
That revealed itself to me very clearly once, when I was
pondering over the parable of the labourers in the vineyard.
You know?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Yes, the labourers.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> That parable seemed to show me
more clearly than anything else where my mistake had
been. Like those labourers I had thought that the vineyard
was my own, and that my life was my own, and
everything seemed dreadful; but as soon as I had understood
that my life is not my own, but that I am sent into
the world to do the will of God&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But what of it? We all know that!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Well, if we know it we cannot go
on living as we are doing, for our whole life&mdash;far from
being a fulfilment of His will&mdash;is, on the contrary, a
continual transgression of it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But how is it a transgression&mdash;when
we live without doing harm to anyone?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> But are we doing no harm? Such
an outlook on life is just like that of those labourers.
Why we&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Yes, I know the parable&mdash;and that he
paid them all equally.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>after a pause</i>] No, it's not that.
But do, Mary, consider one thing&mdash;that we have only one
life, and can live it well, or can waste it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I can't think and argue! I don't sleep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352">352</a></span>at night; I am nursing. I have to manage the whole
house, and instead of helping me, you say things to me
that I don't understand.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Mary!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> And now these visitors.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> No, let us come to an understanding.
[<i>Kisses her</i>] Shan't we?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Yes, only be like you used to be.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I can't, but now listen.</p>

<p><i>The sound of bells and an approaching vehicle are
heard.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I can't now&mdash;they have arrived! I
must go to meet them. [<i>Exit behind corner of house.

later. Well, Ly&uacute;ba, what now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA</span> [<i>seriously</i>] No nonsense, please.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Well, have you convinced her?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Al&iacute;na, what is going on between
us is very important. Jokes are out of place. It is not
I who am convincing her, but life, truth, God: they are
convincing her&mdash;therefore she cannot help being convinced,
if not to-day then to-morrow, if not to-morrow &hellip;
It is awful that no one ever has time. Who is it that

at all, but it seemed to me strange that you wanted to

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> Yes, these are matter-of-fact times
&hellip; But your daughter plays really seriously and well.
Where are the young folk? Not asleep still, surely?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Yes, they went out riding by moonlight
last night, and returned very late. I was nursing baby
and heard them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER SEMY&Oacute;NOVICH.</span> And when will my better-half be
back? Have you sent the coachman for her?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Yes, they went for her quite early;
I expect she will be here soon.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> Did Alex&aacute;ndra Iv&aacute;novna really go on purpose
to fetch Father Ger&aacute;sim?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Yes, the idea occurred to her yesterday,
and she was off at once.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> I don't know, dear Mary Iv&aacute;novna, whether
I am right, but it seems to me that you take it all too
much to heart. I understand him. He is in a very
exalted state of mind. Well, even supposing he does
give to the poor? Don't we anyway think too much
about ourselves?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Yes, if that were all, but you don't
know him; nor all he is after. It is not simply helping
the poor, but a complete revolution, the destruction of
everything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> I do not wish to intrude into your family life,
but if you will allow me&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Not at all&mdash;I look upon you as one of
the family&mdash;especially now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> I should advise you to put your demands to
him openly and frankly, and to come to an agreement as
to the limits&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA</span> [<i>excitedly</i>] There are no limits! He
wants to give away everything. He wishes me now, at
my age, to become a cook and a washerwoman.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> No, is it possible! That is extraordinary.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA</span> [<i>takes a letter out of her pocket</i>] We are
by ourselves and I am glad to tell you all about it. He
wrote me this letter yesterday. I will read it to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> What? He lives in the same house with
you, and writes you letters? How strange!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> No, I understand him there. He gets
so excited when he speaks. I have for some time past
felt anxious about his health.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> What did he write?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> This [<i>reading</i>] &ldquo;You reproach me for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356">356</a></span>upsetting our former way of life, and for not giving you
anything new in exchange, and not saying how I should
like to arrange our family affairs. When we begin to
discuss it we both get excited, and that's why I am
writing to you. I have often told you already why I
cannot continue to live as we have been doing; and I
cannot, in a letter, show you why that is so, nor why we
must live in accord to Christ's teaching. You can do one
of two things: either believe in the truth and voluntarily
go with me, or believe in me and trusting yourself
entirely to me&mdash;follow me.&rdquo; [<i>Stops reading</i>] I can do
neither the one nor the other. I do not consider it
necessary to live as he wishes us to. I have to consider
the children, and I cannot rely on him. [<i>Reads</i>] &ldquo;My
plan is this: We shall give our land to the peasants, retaining
only 135 acres besides the orchards and kitchen-garden
and the meadow by the river. We will try to
work ourselves, but will not force one another, nor the
children. What we keep should still bring us in about
&pound;50 a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> Live on &pound;50 a year&mdash;with seven children! Is
it possible!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Well, here follows his whole plan: to
give up the house and have it turned into a school, and
ourselves to live in the gardener's two-roomed cottage.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> Yes, now I begin to see that there is something
abnormal about it. What did you answer?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I told him I couldn't; that were I
alone I would follow him anywhere, but I have the
children.&hellip; Only think! I am still nursing little
Nicholas. I tell him we can't break up everything like
that. After all, was that what I agreed to when I
married? And now I am no longer young or strong.
Think what it has meant to bear and nurse nine children.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> I never dreamed that things had gone so far.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> That is how things are and I don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357">357</a></span>know what will happen. Yesterday he excused the
Dm&iacute;trovka peasants their rent; and he wants to give the
land to them altogether.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> I do not think you should allow it. It is
your duty to protect your children. If he cannot deal
with the estate, let him hand it over to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But I don't want that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> You ought to take it for the children's sake.
Let him transfer the property to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> My sister Alex&aacute;ndra told him so; but
he says he has no right to do it; and that the land
belongs to those who work it, and that it is his duty to
give it to the peasants.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> Yes, now I see that the matter is far more
serious than I thought.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> And the Priest! The Priest takes his
side, too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> Yes, I noticed that yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> That's why my sister has gone to
Moscow. She wanted to talk things over with a lawyer,
but chiefly she went to fetch Father Ger&aacute;sim that he may
bring his influence to bear.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> Yes, I do not think that Christianity calls
upon us to ruin our families.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But he will not believe even Father
Ger&aacute;sim. He is so firm; and when he talks, you know, I
can't answer him. That's what is so terrible, that it
seems to me he is right.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> That is because you love him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I don't know, but it's terrible, and
everything remains unsettled&mdash;and that is Christianity!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Why have you come out here?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IV&Aacute;N ZY&Aacute;BREV.</span> Too many flies in there, and it's too hot.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">IV&Aacute;N ZY&Aacute;BREV.</span> At home, at this time? Why, he's gone

<p><span class="speaker">WOMAN.</span> He's ill, and what about me? Am I not ill?
When it's work, he's ill; but to merry-make or pull my

What do I care?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> How can you say such wicked
things?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">WOMAN.</span> I know it's a sin; but I can't subdue my heart.
I'm expecting another child, and I have to work for two.
Other people have their harvest in already, and we have
not mowed a quarter of our oats yet. I ought to finish

what the children were about.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> The oats shall be cut&mdash;I'll hire
someone, and to bind the sheaves too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">WOMAN.</span> Oh, binding's nothing. I can do that myself,

<p><span class="speaker">IV&Aacute;N ZY&Aacute;BREV</span> [<i>groans</i>] Oh Lord, if I could but die!</p>

<p><i>Enter Bor&iacute;s.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Can I be of any use?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Here no one can be of use to
another. The evil is too deeply rooted. Here we can
only be of use to ourselves, by seeing on what we build
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362">362</a></span>our happiness. Here is a family: five children, the wife
pregnant, the husband ill, nothing but potatoes to eat,
and at this moment the question is being decided whether
they are to have enough to eat next year or not. Help
is not possible. How can one help? Suppose I hire a
labourer; who will he be? Just such another man: one
who has given up his farming, from drink or from want.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Excuse me, but if so, what are you doing here?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I am learning my own position.
Finding out who weeds our gardens, builds our houses,
makes our garments, and feeds and clothes us. [<i>Peasants

Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich, stopping one of the Peasants</i>] Erm&iacute;l,
won't you take on the job of carting for these people?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ERM&Iacute;L</span> [<i>shakes his head</i>] I would with all my heart, but I
can't possibly do it. I haven't carted my own yet. We
are off now to do some carting. But is Iv&aacute;n dying?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ANOTHER PEASANT.</span> Here's Sebastian, he may take on
the job. I say, Daddy Sebastian! They want a man to
get the oats in.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">SEBASTIAN.</span> Take the job on yourself. At this time of
year one day's work brings a year's food. [<i>The Peasants
pass on</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> They are all half-starved; they
have only bread and water, they are ill, and many of them
are old. That old man, for instance, is ruptured and is
suffering, and yet he works from four in the morning to
ten at night, though he is only half alive. And we? Is
it possible, realising all this, to live quietly and consider
oneself a Christian? Or let alone a Christian&mdash;simply
not a beast?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> But what can one do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Not take part in this evil. Not
own the land, nor devour the fruits of their labour. How
this can be arranged, I don't yet know. The fact of the
matter is&mdash;at any rate it was so with me&mdash;I lived and did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363">363</a></span>not realise how I was living. I did not realise that I am
a son of God and that we are all sons of God&mdash;and all
brothers. But as soon as I realised it&mdash;realised that we
have all an equal right to live&mdash;my whole life was turned
upside down. But I cannot explain it to you now. I will
only tell you this: I was blind, just as my people at home
are, but now my eyes are opened and I cannot help
seeing; and seeing it all, I can't continue to live in such
a way. However, that will keep till later. Now we
must see what can be done.</p>

<p><i>Enter Policeman, Peter, his wife, and boy.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PETER</span> [<i>falls at Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich's feet</i>] Forgive me, for
the Lord's sake, or I'm ruined. How can the woman get

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I will go and write a petition for
you. [<i>To Policeman</i>] Can't you let him remain here for
the present?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">POLICEMAN.</span> Our orders are to take him to the police-station
now.</p>

<p class="scene">In the same country-house. It is raining outside. A

Sty&oacute;pa is standing by the piano. Bor&iacute;s is sitting. Ly&uacute;ba,

stirred by the music.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> That andante! Isn't it lovely!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> No, the scherzo. Though really the whole of

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364">364</a></span>
<span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> But I had no idea you were such an artist. It
is real masterly play. Evidently the difficulties no longer
exist for you, and you think only of the feeling, and
express it with wonderful delicacy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> Yes, and with dignity.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Oacute;NYA.</span> While <em>I</em> felt that it was not at all what I meant
it to be. A great deal remained unexpressed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> What could be better? It was wonderful.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> Schumann is good, but all the same Chopin
takes a stronger hold of one's heart.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> He is more lyrical.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Oacute;NYA.</span> There is no comparison.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> Do you remember his prelude?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Oacute;NYA.</span> Oh, the one called the George Sand prelude?
[<i>Plays the commencement</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> No, not that one. That is very fine, but so
hackneyed. Do play this one. [<i>T&oacute;nya plays what she

<p><span class="speaker">T&Oacute;NYA.</span> Oh, that is a lovely thing. There is something
elemental about it&mdash;older than creation.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA</span> [<i>laughs</i>] Yes, yes. Do play it. But no, you
are too tired. As it is, we have had a delightful morning,
thanks to you.</p>

more peasants waiting outside.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> That is why music is so precious. I understand
Saul. Though I'm not tormented by devils, I still understand
him. No other art can make one so forget everything
else as music does. [<i>Approaches the window. To

<p><span class="speaker">T&Oacute;NYA.</span> But is not this sonata lovely?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> The chief thing is, that it is not important; and
it rather hurts me, when I think of the lives men live,
that so much importance is attached to music.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> How nice it is to have a fianc&eacute; here and sweetmeats

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Oh that is not my doing. It's mamma's.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Oacute;NYA.</span> And quite right too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> Music is precious because it seizes us, takes
possession of us, and carries us away from reality. Everything
seemed gloomy till you suddenly began to play,
and really it has made everything brighter.</p>

all the same&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Where's mamma?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> I think she's in the nursery.</p>

<p><i>Sty&oacute;pa calls the Man-servant.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> Papa, how wonderfully T&oacute;nya plays! And
where have you been?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> In the village.</p>

<p><i>Enter servant, Afan&aacute;sy.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> Bring another samov&aacute;r.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>greets the Man-servant, and shakes
hands with him</i><a name="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>] Good-day. [<i>Servant becomes confused.
Exit Servant. Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich also goes off</i>].</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366">366</a></span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> Poor Afan&aacute;sy! He was terribly confused. I
can't understand papa. It is as if we were guilty of
something.</p>

<p><i>Enter Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I was going back to my room
without having told you what I feel. <ins title="(To T&oacute;nya)">[<i>To T&oacute;nya</i>]</ins> If what
I say should offend you&mdash;who are our guest&mdash;forgive me,
but I cannot help saying it. You, Lisa, say that T&oacute;nya
plays well. All you here, seven or eight healthy young
men and women, have slept till ten o'clock, have eaten
and drunk and are still eating; and you play and discuss
music: while there, where I have just been, they were
all up at three in the morning, and those who pastured
the horses at night have not slept at all; and old and
young, the sick and the weak, children and nursing-mothers
and pregnant women are working to the utmost
limits of their strength, so that we here may consume the
fruits of their labour. Nor is that all. At this very
moment, one of them, the only breadwinner of a family,
is being dragged to prison because he has cut down one
of a hundred thousand pine-trees that grow in the forest
that is called <em>mine</em>. And we here, washed and clothed,
having left the slops in our bedrooms to be cleaned up
by slaves, eat and drink and discuss Schumann and
Chopin and which of them moves us most or best cures
our ennui? That is what I was thinking when I passed
you, so I have spoken. Consider, is it possible to go
on living in this way? [<i>Stands greatly agitated</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> True, quite true!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> If one lets oneself think about it, one can't
live.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> Why? I don't see why the fact that people
are poor should prevent one talking about Schumann.
The one does not exclude the other. If one&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>angrily</i>] If one has no heart, if
one is made of wood&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367">367</a></span>
<span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> Well, I'll hold my tongue.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Oacute;NYA.</span> It is a terrible problem; it is the problem of
our day; and we should not be afraid of it, but look it
straight in the face, in order to solve it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> We cannot wait for the problem
to be solved by public measures. Every one of us must
die&mdash;if not to-day, then to-morrow. How can I live
without suffering from this internal discord?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Of course there is only one way; that is, not
to take part in it at all.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Well, forgive me if I have hurt
you. I could not help saying what I felt. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> Not take part in it? But our whole life is
bound up with it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> That is why he says that the first step is to
possess no property; to change our whole way of life and
live so as not to be served by others but to serve others.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">T&Oacute;NYA.</span> Well, I see <em>you</em> have quite gone over to
Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich's side.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Yes, I now understand it for the first time&mdash;after
what I saw in the village.&hellip; You need only take off
the spectacles through which we are accustomed to look
at the life of the people, to realise at once the connection
between their sufferings and our pleasures&mdash;that is
enough!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MITROF&Aacute;N ERM&Iacute;LYCH.</span> Yes, but the remedy does not
consist in ruining one's own life.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> It is surprising how Mitrof&aacute;n Erm&iacute;lych and I,
though we usually stand poles asunder, come to the same
conclusion: those are my very words, &ldquo;not ruin one's
own life.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Naturally! You both of you wish to lead a
pleasant life, and therefore want life arranged so as to
ensure that pleasant life for you. [<i>To Sty&oacute;pa</i>] You wish to
maintain the present system, while Mitrof&aacute;n Erm&iacute;lych
wants to establish a new one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368">368</a></span>
<i>Ly&uacute;ba and T&oacute;nya whisper together. T&oacute;nya goes to the
piano and plays a nocturne by Chopin. General silence.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> That's splendid; that solves everything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> It obscures and postpones everything!</p>

<p><i>While T&oacute;nya is playing, Mary Iv&aacute;novna and the Princess

<p><i>Before the end of the nocturne carriage bells are heard
outside.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> It is Aunt. [<i>Goes to meet her</i>].</p>

<p><i>The music continues. Enter Alex&aacute;ndra Iv&aacute;novna, Father
Ger&aacute;sim (a priest with a cross round his neck) and a Notary.
All rise.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> Please go on, it is very pleasant.</p>

<p><i>The Princess approaches to receive his blessing, and the
young Priest does the same.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I have done exactly what I said I
would do. I found Father Ger&aacute;sim, and you see I have
persuaded him to come&mdash;he was on his way to Koursk&mdash;so
I have done my part; and here is the Notary. He
has got the deed ready; it only needs signing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Won't you have some lunch?</p>

<p><i>Notary puts down his papers on the table, and exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I am very grateful to Father Ger&aacute;sim.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM</span>. What else could I do&mdash;though it was
out of my way&mdash;yet as a Christian I considered it my
duty to visit him.</p>

<p><i>Alex&aacute;ndra Iv&aacute;novna whispers to the young people. They
consult together and go out on to the verandah, all except
Bor&iacute;s. The young Priest also wants to go.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span><a name="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> No. You as a pastor and spiritual
father must remain here! You may benefit by it yourself,
and may be of use to others. Stay here, if Mary
Iv&aacute;novna has no objection.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> No, I am as fond of Father Vas&iacute;ly as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369">369</a></span>if he were one of the family. I have even consulted
him; but being so young he has not much authority.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> Naturally, naturally.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA</span> [<i>approaching</i>] Well, you see now,
Father Ger&aacute;sim, that you are the only person who can
help and can bring him to reason. He is a clever, well-read
man, but learning, you know, can only do harm. He
is suffering from some sort of delusion. He maintains
that the Christian law forbids a man to own any property;
but how is that possible?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> Temptation, spiritual pride, self-will!
The Fathers of the Church have answered the question
satisfactorily. But how did this befall him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Well, to tell you everything &hellip; when
we married he was quite indifferent to religion, and
we lived so, and lived happily, during our best years&mdash;the
first twenty years. Then he began to reflect. Perhaps
he was influenced by his sister, or by what he read.
Anyhow, he began thinking and reading the Gospels,
and then suddenly he grew extremely religious, began
going to church and visiting the monks. Then all at
once he gave all this up and changed his way of life
completely. He began doing manual labour, would not
let the servants wait on him, and above all he is now
giving away his property. He yesterday gave away a
forest&mdash;both the trees and land. It frightens me, for I
have seven children. Do talk to him. I'll go and ask
him whether he will see you. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> Nowadays many are falling away.
And is the estate his or his wife's?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> His! That's what is so unfortunate.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> And what is his official rank?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> His rank is not high. Only that of a cavalry
captain, I believe. He was once in the army.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> There are many who turn aside in
that way. In Odessa there was a lady who was carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370">370</a></span>away by Spiritualism and began to do much harm. But all
the same, God enabled us to lead her back to the Church.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> The chief thing, please understand, is that my
son is about to marry his daughter. I have given my
consent, but the girl is used to luxury and should therefore
be provided for, and not have to depend entirely on
my son. Though I admit he is a hard-working and an
exceptional young man.</p>

<p><i>Enter Mary Iv&aacute;novna and Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> How d'you do, Princess? How
d'you do? [<i>To Father Ger&aacute;sim</i>] I beg your pardon. I
don't know your name.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> Do you not wish to receive my
blessing?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> No, I don't.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> My name is Ger&aacute;sim S&eacute;dorovitch.
Very pleased to meet you.</p>

<p><i>Men-servants bring lunch and wine.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> Pleasant weather, and good for the
harvest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I suppose you came, at Alex&aacute;ndra
Iv&aacute;novna's invitation, to divert me from my errors and
direct me in the path of truth. If that is so, don't let
us beat about the bush, but let us get to business at once.
I do not deny that I disagree with the teaching of the
Church. I used to agree with it, and then left off doing
so. But with my whole heart I wish to be in the truth
and will at once accept it if you show it to me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> How is it you say you don't believe
the teaching of the Church? What is there to believe
in, if not the Church?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> God and His law, given to us in
the Gospels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371">371</a></span>
<span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> The Church teaches that very law.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> If it did so, I should believe in the
Church, but unfortunately it teaches the contrary.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> The Church cannot teach the contrary,
because it was established by the Lord himself. It is
written, &ldquo;I give you power,&rdquo; and, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will
build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> That was not said in this connection
at all, and proves nothing. But even if we were
to admit that Christ established the Church, how do I
know that it was <em>your</em> Church?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> Because it is said, &ldquo;Where two or
three are gathered together in my name, there am I in
the midst of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> That, too, was not said in this
connection, and proves nothing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> How <em>can</em> one deny the Church? It
alone provides salvation.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I did not deny the Church until
I found it supported everything that is contrary to
Christianity.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> It can make no mistakes, for it alone
has the truth. Those who leave it go astray, but the
Church is sacred.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I have already told you that I do
not accept that. I do not accept it because, as is said in
the Gospels, &ldquo;By their deeds shall ye know them, by
their fruit shall ye know them.&rdquo; I have found out that the
Church blesses oaths, murders and executions.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> The Church acknowledges and
sanctifies the Powers ordained by God.</p>

<p><i>During the conversation, Sty&oacute;pa, Ly&uacute;ba, Lisa and T&oacute;nya
at different times enter the room and sit or stand listening.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I know that the Gospels say, not
only &ldquo;Do not kill,&rdquo; but &ldquo;Do not be angry,&rdquo; yet the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372">372</a></span>Church blesses the army. The Gospel says, &ldquo;Swear not
at all,&rdquo; yet the Church administers oaths. The Gospel
says&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> Excuse me. When Pilate<a name="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> said, &ldquo;I
adjure thee by the living God,&rdquo; Christ accepted his
oath by replying &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Dear me! What are you saying?
That is really absurd.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> That is why the Church does not
permit everyone to interpret the Gospel, lest he should
go astray, but like a mother caring for her child gives
him an interpretation suitable to his strength. No, let
me finish! The Church does not lay on its children
burdens too heavy for them to bear, but demands that
they should keep the Commandments: love, do no
murder, do not steal, do not commit adultery.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Yes! Do not kill me, do not steal
from me my stolen goods. We have all robbed the
people, we have stolen their land and have then made a
law forbidding them to steal it back; and the Church
sanctions all these things.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> Heresy and spiritual pride are speaking
through you. You ought to conquer your intellectual
pride.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> It is not pride. I am only asking
you what should I do according to Christ's law, when I have
become conscious of the sin of robbing the people and
enslaving them by means of the land. How am I to act?
Continue to own land and to profit by the labour of
starving men: putting them to this kind of work [<i>points
to Servant who is bringing in the lunch and some wine</i>], or am
I to return the land to those from whom my ancestors
stole it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> You must act as behoves a son of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373">373</a></span>Church. You have a family and children, and you must
keep and educate them in a way suitable to their position.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Why?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> Because God has placed you in that
position. If you wish to be charitable, be charitable by
giving away part of your property and by visiting the
poor.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> But how is it that the rich young
man was told that the rich cannot enter the Kingdom of
Heaven?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> It is said, &ldquo;If thou wouldest be
perfect.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> But I <em>do</em> wish to be perfect.
The Gospels say, &ldquo;Be ye perfect as your Father in
Heaven&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> But we have to understand in what
connection a thing is said.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I do try to understand, and all
that is said in the Sermon on the Mount is plain and
comprehensible.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> Spiritual pride.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Where is the pride, since it is said
that what is hidden from the wise is revealed to babes?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> Revealed to the meek, but not to the
proud.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> But who is proud? I, who consider
myself a man like the rest of mankind, and one who
therefore must live like the rest by his own labour and
as poorly as his brother men, or those who consider themselves
to be specially selected sacred people, knowing the
whole truth and incapable of error; and who interpret
Christ's words their own way?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM</span> [<i>offended</i>] Pardon me, Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich,
I did not come here to argue which of us is right, nor to
receive an admonition, but I called, at Alex&aacute;ndra Iv&aacute;novna's
request, to talk things over with you. But since you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374">374</a></span>know everything better than I do, we had better end our
conversation. Only, once again, I must entreat you in
God's name to come to your senses. You have gone
cruelly astray and are ruining yourself. [<i>Rises</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Won't you have something to eat?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">FATHER GER&Aacute;SIM.</span> No, I thank you. [<i>Exit with Alex&aacute;ndra
Iv&aacute;novna</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA</span> [<i>to young Priest</i>] And what now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Well, in my opinion, Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich spoke
the truth, and Father Ger&aacute;sim produced no argument on
his side.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> He was not allowed to speak, and he did not
like having a kind of debate with everybody listening.
It was his modesty that made him withdraw.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> It wasn't modesty at all. All he said was so
false. It was evident that he had nothing to say.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> Yes, with your usual instability I see that
you are beginning to agree with Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich about
everything. If you believe such things you ought not to
marry.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> I only say that truth is truth, and I can't help
saying it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> You of all people should not talk like that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Why not?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> Because you are poor, and have nothing to
give away. However, all this is not our business. [<i>Exit,
followed by all except Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich and Mary Iv&aacute;novna</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>sits pondering, then smiles at his own
thoughts</i>] Mary! What is all this for? Why did you
invite that wretched, erring man? Why do those noisy
women and that priest come into our most intimate life?
Can we not settle our own affairs?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> What am I to do, if you want to leave
the children penniless? That is what I cannot quietly
submit to. You know that I am not grasping, and that I
want nothing for myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375">375</a></span>
<span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I know, I know and believe it.
But the misfortune is that you do not trust the truth.
I know you see it, but you can't make up your mind to
rely on it. You rely neither on the truth nor on me.
Yet you trust the crowd&mdash;the Princess and the rest of them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I believe in you, I always did; but
when you want to let the children go begging&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> That means that you do not rely
on me. Do you think I have not struggled and have not
feared! But afterwards I became convinced that this
course is not only possible but obligatory, and that it is the
one thing necessary and good for the children themselves.
You always say that were it not for the children you
would follow me, but I say that if we had no children we
might live as we are doing; we should then only be
injuring ourselves, but now we are injuring them too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But what am I to do, if I don't understand?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> And what am I to do? Don't I
know why that wretched man&mdash;dressed up in his cassock
and wearing that cross&mdash;was sent for, and why Alex&aacute;ndra
Iv&aacute;novna brought the Notary? You want me to hand
the estate over to you, but I can't. You know that I
have loved you all the twenty years we have lived
together. I love you and wish you well, and therefore
cannot sign away the estate to you. If I sign it away at
all, it can only be to give it back to those from whom it
has been taken&mdash;the peasants. And I can't let things
remain as they are, but must give it to them. I'm glad
the Notary has come; and I will do it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> No, that is dreadful! Why this
cruelty? Though you think it a sin, still give it to me.
[<i>Weeps</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> You don't know what you are
saying. If I give it to you, I cannot go on living with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376">376</a></span>you; I shall have to go away. I cannot continue to live
under these conditions. I shall not be able to look on while
the life-blood is squeezed out of the peasants and they
are imprisoned, in your name if not in mine. So choose!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> How cruel you are! Is this Christianity?
It is harshness! I cannot, after all, live as you
want me to. I cannot rob my own children and give
everything away to other people; and that is why you
want to desert me. Well&mdash;do so! I see you have ceased
loving me, and I even know why.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Very well then&mdash;I will sign; but,
Mary, you demand the impossible of me. [<i>Goes to writing-table
and signs</i>] You wished it, but I shall not be able to
go on living like this.</p>

<h2>ACT III</h2>


<h3 class="smcap">Scene 1</h3>

<p class="scene">The scene is laid in Moscow. A large room. In it a
carpenter's bench; a table with papers on it; a book-cupboard;
a looking-glass and pictures on the wall behind, with
some planks leaning in front of them. A Carpenter and
Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich wearing a carpenter's apron are working
at the bench, planing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>takes a board from the vice</i>] Is that
all right?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CARPENTER</span> [<i>setting a plane</i>] Not quite, you must do it
more boldly&mdash;like this.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> It is easy to say boldly, but I can't
manage it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CARPENTER.</span> But why should your honour trouble to
learn to be a carpenter? There are such a lot of us
nowadays that we can hardly get a living as it is.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>at work again</i>] I'm ashamed to
lead an idle life.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CARPENTER.</span> Yours is that kind of position. God has
given you property.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> That's just where it is. I don't
believe that God gave it, but that some of us have taken
it, and taken it from our brother men.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CARPENTER</span> [<i>taken aback</i>] That's so! But still you've
no need to do this.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I understand that it must seem
strange to you that while living in this house where
there is such superfluity, I should wish to earn something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378">378</a></span>
<span class="speaker">CARPENTER</span> [<i>laughs</i>] No. Everybody knows that gentlefolk
want to master everything. Well, now go over it again
with the smoothing plane.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> You won't believe me and will
laugh, but still I must tell you that formerly I was not
ashamed to live in this way, but now that I believe in
Christ's law, which tells us we are all brothers&mdash;I am
ashamed to live so.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CARPENTER.</span> If you are ashamed of it, give away your
property.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I wanted to, but failed, and gave
it to my wife.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CARPENTER.</span> But after all it would not be possible for
you to do it&mdash;you are too used to comforts.</p>

<p>[<i>Voice outside the door</i>] Papa, may I come in?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> You may, you always may.</p>

<p><i>Enter Ly&uacute;ba.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> Good-day, Jacob!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CARPENTER.</span> Good-day, Miss!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> Bor&iacute;s has gone to his regiment. I am afraid of
what he may do or say there. What do you think?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> What can I think? He will do
what is natural to him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> It is awful. He has such a short time to serve<a name="FNanchor_33_33" href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
and may go and ruin his whole life.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> He did well not to come to see
me. He understands that I can't say anything to him
but what he knows himself. He told me that he handed
in his resignation because he sees that not only is there
no more immoral, lawless, cruel and brutal occupation
than this one, the object of which is to kill, but also that
there is nothing more degrading and mean than to have
to submit implicitly to any man of higher rank who
happens to come along. He knows all that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379">379</a></span>
<span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> That's just why I am afraid. He knows that,
and may want to take some action.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> His conscience&mdash;the God that
dwells within him&mdash;will decide that. Had he come to
me I should have given him only one piece of advice:
not to do anything in which he is guided by his reason
alone&mdash;nothing is worse than that&mdash;but only to act when
his whole being demands it. Now I, for instance, wished
to act according to Christ's injunction: to leave father,
wife and children and to follow Him, and I left home,
but how did it end? It ended by my coming back and
living with you in luxury in town. Because I was trying
to do more than I had strength for, I have landed myself
in this degrading and senseless position: I wish to live
simply and to work with my hands, but in these surroundings,
with lackeys and porters, it seems a kind of affectation.
I see that, even now, Jacob Nikon&oacute;rych is laughing at me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CARPENTER.</span> Why should I laugh? You pay me, and
give me my tea. I am grateful to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> I wonder if I had not better go to him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> My dear, my darling, I know you
find it hard and are frightened, though you should not
be so. After all, I am a man who understands life.
Nothing evil can happen. All that appears evil really
makes one's heart more joyful; only understand that a
man who has started on that path will have to choose,
and it sometimes happens that God's side and the
Devil's weigh so equally that the scales oscillate, and it
is then that the great choice has to be made. At that
point any interference from outside is terribly dangerous
and tormenting. It is as though a man were making
such terrible efforts to draw a weight over a ridge that
the slightest touch would cause him to break his back.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> Why should he suffer so?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> That is as though a mother were
to ask why she should suffer. There can be no childbirth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380">380</a></span>without suffering, and it is the same in spiritual
life. One thing I can tell you. Bor&iacute;s is a true Christian,
and consequently is free, and if you cannot as yet be like
him, or believe in God as he does, then believe in God
through him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA</span> [<i>behind door</i>] May I come in?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> You may always come in. What
a reception I'm having here to-day.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Our priest, Vas&iacute;ly Nikon&oacute;rovich, has
come. He is going to the Bishop, and has resigned his
living!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Impossible!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> He is here! Ly&uacute;ba, go and call him!
He wants to see you. [<i>Exit Ly&uacute;ba</i>]. I had another
reason for coming. I want to speak to you about V&aacute;nya.
He behaves abominably, and does his lesson so badly that
he can't possibly pass; and when I speak to him he is rude.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Mary, you know I am out of
sympathy with the whole manner of life you are all
leading, and with the education you are giving to the
children. It is a terrible question for me, whether I have
a right to see them perishing before my very eyes&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Then you should suggest something
else, something definite. But what do you offer?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I cannot say what. But can only
say that first we should get rid of all this depraving luxury.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> So that they should become peasants!
I cannot agree to that.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Then don't consult me. The
things that grieve you are natural and inevitable.</p>

<p><i>Enter Priest and Ly&uacute;ba. The Priest and Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich

<span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Is it possible that you have thrown
it all up?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> I could stand it no longer.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I did not expect it so soon.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> But it was really impossible. In our calling
we cannot be indifferent. We have to hear confessions,
and to administer the Sacrament, and when once one has
become convinced that it is all not true&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Well, and what now?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Now I am going to the Bishop to be questioned.
I am afraid he will exile me to the Solov&eacute;tsk Monastery.
At one time I thought of asking you to help me to
escape abroad, but then I considered that it would seem
cowardly. Only, there is my wife!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Where is she?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> She has gone to her father's. My mother-in-law

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS</span> [<i>running into the room</i>] There now, it has

Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich, you must go.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> Has he refused? How do you know?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> I was there myself! Vas&iacute;ly Andr&eacute;evich,

Bor&iacute;s just walked in and told them he would serve no

Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich has taught him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Princess! Can such things be
taught?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> I don't know. Only this is not Christianity!
What is your opinion, Father?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> I am no longer &ldquo;Father.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382">382</a></span>
<span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> Well, all the same. However, you are also
one of them! No, I cannot leave things in this state.
And what cursed Christianity it is that makes people
suffer and perish. I hate this Christianity of yours. It's
all right for you, who know you won't be touched; but I
have only one son, and you have ruined him!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Do be calm, Princess.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> Yes you, you have ruined him! And having

<h3 class="smcap"><ins title="Scene 2.">Scene 2</ins></h3>

<p class="scene">A Government office. A Clerk is seated at a table, and a
Sentinel is pacing up and down. Enter a General with his
Adjutant. The Clerk jumps up, the Sentinel presents arms.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> Where is the Colonel?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CLERK.</span> Gone to see that new conscript, Your Excellency.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> Ah, very well. Ask him to come here to me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CLERK.</span> Yes, Your Excellency.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> And what are you copying out? Isn't it the
conscript's evidence?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CLERK.</span> Yes, sir, it is.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> Give it here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383">383</a></span>
<i>The Clerk hands General the paper and exit. The General
hands it to his Adjutant.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> Please read it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ADJUTANT</span> [<i>reading</i>] &ldquo;These are my answers to the
questions put to me, namely: (1) Why I do not take
my oath. (2) Why I refuse to fulfil the demands of the
Government. (3) What induced me to use words offensive
not only to the army but also to the Highest Authorities.
In reply to the first question: I cannot take the oath
because I accept Christ's teaching, which directly and
clearly forbids taking oaths, as in St. Matthew's Gospel,
ch.&nbsp;5 vv.&nbsp;33&ndash;37, and in the Epistle of St. James, ch.&nbsp;5
v.&nbsp;12.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> Of course he must be arguing! Putting his
own interpretations!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ADJUTANT</span> [<i>goes on reading</i>] &ldquo;The Gospel says: &#8216;Swear
not at all, but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay; and
what is more than these is of the evil one!&#8217; St. James's
Epistle says: &#8216;Before all things, brethren, swear not by
the heavens nor by the earth, nor by any other oath; but
let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay, that ye fall not
into temptation!&#8217; But apart from the fact that the Bible
gives us such clear injunctions not to swear&mdash;or even if
it contained no such injunctions&mdash;I should still be unable
to swear to obey the will of men, because as a Christian I
must always obey the will of God, which does not always
coincide with the will of men.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> He must be arguing! If I had my way, there
would be none of this.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ADJUTANT</span> [<i>reading</i>] &ldquo;I refuse to fulfil the demands of
men calling themselves the Government, because&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> What insolence!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ADJUTANT.</span> &ldquo;Because those demands are criminal and
wicked. They demand of me that I should enter the
army, and learn and prepare to commit murder, though
this is forbidden both in the Old and the New Testaments,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384">384</a></span>and above all by my conscience. To the third
question&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Enter Colonel followed by Clerk. The General shakes
hands with Colonel.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">COLONEL.</span> You are reading the evidence?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> Yes. Unpardonably insolent language. Well,
go on.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ADJUTANT.</span> &ldquo;To the third question: What induced me
to use offensive words before the Court, my answer is:
that I was induced to do so by the wish to serve God,
and in order to expose the fraud carried on in His name.
This desire, I hope to retain till I die, and therefore&nbsp;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> Come; that's enough; one can't listen to all
this balderdash. The fact is all this sort of thing must
be eradicated, and action taken to prevent the people
being perverted. [<i>To Colonel</i>] Have you spoken to him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">COLONEL.</span> I have been doing so all the time. I tried to
shame him, and also to convince him that it would only
be worse for himself, and that he would gain nothing by
it. Besides that, I spoke of his relations. He was very
excited, but holds to his opinions.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> A pity you talked to him so much. We are
in the army not to reason, but to act. Call him here!</p>

<p><i>Exit Adjutant with Clerk.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL</span> [<i>sits down</i>] No, Colonel, that's not the way.
Fellows of this kind must be dealt with in a different
manner. Decisive measures are needed to cut off the
diseased limb. One maggoty sheep infects the whole
flock. In these cases one must not be too squeamish.
His being a Prince, and having a mother and a fianc&eacute;e, is
none of our business. We have a soldier before us and
we must obey the Tsar's will.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">COLONEL.</span> I only thought that we could move him more
easily by persuasion.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> Not at all&mdash;by firmness; only by firmness! I
have dealt with men of that sort before. He must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385">385</a></span>made to feel that he is a nonentity&mdash;a grain of dust
beneath a chariot wheel, and that he cannot stop it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">COLONEL.</span> Well, we can try!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL</span> [<i>getting irritable</i>] No need to try! I don't
need to try! I have served the Tsar for forty-four years,
I have given and am giving my life to the service, and
now this fellow wants to teach me and wants to read
me theological lectures! Let him take that to the Priest,
but to me&mdash;he is either a soldier or a prisoner.
That's all!</p>

<p><i>Enter Bor&iacute;s guarded by two Soldiers and followed by
Adjutant and Clerk.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL</span> [<i>pointing with a finger</i>] Place him there.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> I need no placing. I shall stand or sit where I
like, for I do not recognise your authority.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> Silence! You don't recognise authority? I
will make you recognise it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S</span> [<i>sits down on a stool</i>] How wrong it is of you to
shout so!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> Lift him, and make him stand!</p>

<p><i>Soldiers raise him.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> That you can do, and you can kill me; but you
cannot make me submit&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> Silence, I tell you. Hear what I have to say
to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> I don't in the least want to hear what you have
to say.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> He is mad! He must be taken to the
hospital to be examined. That is the only thing to do.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">COLONEL.</span> The order was to send him to be examined
at the Gendarmes' office.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> Well, then, send him there. Only put him
into uniform.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">COLONEL.</span> He resists.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> Bind him. [<i>To Bor&iacute;s</i>] Please hear what I have
to say to you. I don't care what happens to you, but for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386">386</a></span>your own sake I advise you, bethink yourself. You will
rot in a fortress, and not do any good to anyone. Give
it up. Well, you flared up a bit and I flared up. [<i>Slaps
him on the shoulder</i>] Go, take the oath and give up all that
nonsense. [<i>To Adjutant</i>] Is the Priest here? [<i>To Bor&iacute;s</i>]
Well? [<i>Bor&iacute;s is silent</i>] Why don't you answer? Really
you had better do as I say. You can't break a club with
a whip. You can keep your opinions, but serve your
time! We will not use force with you. Well?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> I have nothing more to say, I have said all I
had to.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENERAL.</span> There, you see, you wrote that there are such
and such texts in the Gospels. Well, the Priest knows
all about that. Have a talk with the Priest, and then
think things over. That will be best. Good-bye, and I
hope &ldquo;au revoir,&rdquo; when I shall be able to congratulate
you on having entered the Tsar's service. Send the
Priest here. [<i>Exit, followed by Colonel and Adjutant</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S</span> [<i>To Clerk and Convoy Soldiers</i>] There you see how
they deceive you. They know that they are deceiving
you. Don't submit to them. Lay down your rifles and
go away. Let them put you into the Disciplinary
Battalions and flog you; it will not be as bad as it is to
serve such impostors.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">CLERK.</span> But how could one get on without an army?
It's impossible.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> That is not for us to consider. We have to
consider what God demands of us; and God wants
us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ONE OF THE SOLDIERS.</span> But how is it that they speak of
&ldquo;the Christian army&rdquo;?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> That is not said anywhere in the Bible. It's
these impostors who invented it.</p>

<p><i>Enter a Gendarme Officer with Clerk.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENDARME OFFICER.</span> Is it here that the conscript, Prince
Cheremsh&aacute;nov, is being kept?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387">387</a></span>
<span class="speaker">CLERK.</span> Yes, sir. Here he is.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENDARME OFFICER.</span> Come here, please. Are you Prince
Bor&iacute;s Sim&eacute;novich Cheremsh&aacute;nov, who refuses to take
the oath?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> I am.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENDARME OFFICER</span> [<i>sits down and points to a seat
opposite</i>] Please sit down.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> I think our conversation will be quite useless.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENDARME OFFICER.</span> I don't think so. At any rate not
useless to you. You see it's like this. I am informed
that you refuse military service and the oath, and are
therefore suspected of belonging to the Revolutionary
Party, and that is what I have to investigate. If it is
true, we shall have to withdraw you from the service and
imprison you or banish you according to the share you
have taken in the revolution. If it is not true, we shall
leave you to the military authorities. You see I express
myself quite frankly to you, and I hope you will treat
us in the same way.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> In the first place I cannot trust men who wear
this sort of thing [<i>pointing to the Gendarme Officer's uniform</i>].
Secondly, your very occupation is one I cannot respect,
and for which I have the greatest aversion. But I do
not refuse to answer your questions. What do you wish
to know?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENDARME OFFICER.</span> In the first place, tell me your name,
your calling, and your religion?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> You know all that and I will not reply. Only
one of the questions is of great importance to me. I am
<em>not</em> what is called an Orthodox Christian.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENDARME OFFICER.</span> What then is your religion?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> I do not label it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENDARME OFFICER.</span> But still?&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Well then, the Christian religion, according to
the Sermon on the Mount.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENDARME OFFICER.</span> Write it down [<i>Clerk writes. To
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388">388</a></span>Bor&iacute;s</i>] Still you recognise yourself as belonging to some
nationality or rank.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> No, I don't. I recognise myself as a man, and
a servant of God.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENDARME OFFICER.</span> Why don't you consider yourself a
member of the Russian Empire?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Because I do not recognise any empires.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENDARME OFFICER.</span> What do you mean by not recognising?
Do you wish to overthrow them?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Certainly I wish it, and work for it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENDARME OFFICER</span> [<i>To Clerk</i>] Put that down. [<i>To Bor&iacute;s</i>]
How do you work for it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> By exposing fraud and lies, and by spreading
the truth. When you entered I was telling these
soldiers not to believe in the fraud into which they
have been drawn.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENDARME OFFICER.</span> But beside this method of exposing
and persuading, do you approve of any others?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> No, I not only disapprove, but I consider all
violence to be a great sin; and not only violence, but all
concealment and craftiness&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENDARME OFFICER.</span> Write that down. Very well. Now
kindly let me know whom you are acquainted with. Do
you know Ivash&eacute;nko?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENDARME OFFICER.</span> Klein?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> I have heard of him, but never met him.</p>

<p><i>Enter Priest (an old man wearing a cross and carrying
a Bible). The Clerk goes up to him and receives his
blessing.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENDARME OFFICER.</span> Well, I think I may stop. I consider
that you are not dangerous, and not within our jurisdiction.
I wish you a speedy release. Good-day. [<i>Presses
Bor&iacute;s's hand</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> One thing I should like to say to you. Forgive
me, but I can't help saying it. Why have you chosen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389">389</a></span>this wicked, cruel profession? I should advise you to
give it up.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">GENDARME OFFICER</span> [<i>smiles</i>] Thank you for your advice,
but I have my reasons. My respects to you. [<i>To Priest</i>]
Father, I relinquish my place to you [<i>Exit with Clerk</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> How can you so grieve the authorities by refusing
to fulfil the duty of a Christian, to serve the Tsar
and your Fatherland?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S</span> [<i>smiling</i>] Just because I want to fulfil my duty as
a Christian, I do not wish to be a soldier.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Why don't you wish it? It is said that,
&ldquo;To lay down one's life for a friend&rdquo; is to be a true
Christian.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Yes, to &ldquo;lay down one's life,&rdquo; but not to take
another man's. That is just what I want to do, to &ldquo;lay
down my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> You do not reason rightly, young man. John
the Baptist said to the soldiers&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S</span> [<i>smiling</i>] That only goes to prove that even in
those days the soldiers used to rob, and he told them
not to!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Well, but why don't you wish to take your oath?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> You know that the Gospels forbid it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Not at all. You know that when Pilate said:
&ldquo;I adjure thee by the living God, art thou the Christ?&rdquo;
the Lord Jesus Christ answered &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; That proves
that oaths are not forbidden.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Are not you ashamed to talk so? You&mdash;an
old man.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Take my advice and don't be obstinate. You
and I cannot change the world. Just take your oath
and you'll be at ease. Leave it to the Church to know
what is a sin and what is not.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Leave it to you? Are you not afraid to take so
much sin upon yourself?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> What sin? Having been brought up firmly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390">390</a></span>in the faith, and having worked as a priest for thirty
years, I can have no sins on my shoulders.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Whose then is the sin, when you deceive such
numbers of people? What have these poor fellows got
in their heads? [<i>Points to Sentinel</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> You and I, young man, will never settle that.
It is for us to obey those placed above us.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Leave me alone! I am sorry for you and&mdash;I
confess&mdash;it disgusts me to listen to you. Now if you were
like that General&mdash;but you come here with a cross and the
Testament to persuade me in the name of Christ, to deny
Christ! Go [<i>excitedly</i>]. Leave me&mdash;Go. Let me be
taken back to the cell that I may not see anyone. I am
tired, dreadfully tired!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Well, if that is so, good-bye.</p>

<p><i>Enter Adjutant.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ADJUTANT.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Great obstinacy, great insubordination.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ADJUTANT.</span> So he has refused to take the oath and to
serve?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> On no account will he.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ADJUTANT.</span> Then he must be taken to the hospital.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> And reported as ill? That no doubt would be
better, or his example may lead others astray.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ADJUTANT.</span> To be put under observation in the ward for
the mentally diseased. Those are my orders.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRIEST.</span> Certainly. My respects to you. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ADJUTANT</span> [<i>approaches Bor&iacute;s</i>] Come, please. My orders
are to conduct <span class="nowrap">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Where to?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ADJUTANT.</span> First of all to the hospital, where it will be
quieter for you, and where you will have time to think
things over.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> I've thought them over long ago. But let us
go! [<i>Exeunt</i>].</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Scene 3</h3>

<p class="scene">Room in Hospital. Head Doctor, Assistant Doctor, an
Officer-Patient in a dressing-gown, and two Warders
wearing blouses.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PATIENT.</span> I tell you that you are only leading me to
perdition. I have already several times felt quite well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> You must not get excited. I should be
glad to sign an order for you to leave the hospital, but
you know yourself that liberty is dangerous for you. If
I were sure that you would be looked after&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PATIENT.</span> You think I should take to drink again? No,
I have had my lesson, but every extra day I spend here
only does me harm. You are doing [<i>gets excited</i>] the
opposite of what you ought to do. You are cruel. It's
all very well for <em>you</em>!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> Don't get excited. [<i>Makes a sign to
Warders; who come up from behind</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PATIENT.</span> It's easy for you to argue, being at liberty;
but how about us who are kept among madmen! [<i>To
Warders</i>] What are you after? Be off!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> I beg of you to be calm.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PATIENT.</span> But I beg and I demand that you set me
free. [<i>Yells, and rushes at the Doctor, but the Warders seize
him. A struggle; after which he is taken out</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ASSISTANT DOCTOR.</span> There! Now it has begun again.
He nearly got at you that time.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> Alcoholic &hellip; nothing can be done.
But there is some improvement.</p>

<p><i>Enter Adjutant.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ADJUTANT.</span> How d'you do.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> Good morning!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ADJUTANT.</span> I have brought you an interesting fellow, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392">392</a></span>certain Prince Cheremsh&aacute;nov, who has been conscripted,
but on religious grounds refuses to serve. He was sent
to the Gendarmes, but they say he does not come within
their jurisdiction, not being a political conspirator. The
Priest exhorted him, but also without effect.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR</span> [<i>laughing</i>] And then as usual you bring
him to us, as the highest Court of Appeal. Well, let's
have him.</p>

<p><i>Exit Assistant Doctor.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ADJUTANT.</span> He is said to be a highly educated young
man, and he is engaged to a rich girl. It's extraordinary!
I really consider this is the right place for him!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> Yes, it's a mania.</p>

<p><i>Bor&iacute;s is brought in.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> Glad to see you. Please take a seat and
let's have a chat. [<i>To Adjutant</i>] Please leave us. [<i>Exit
Adjutant</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> I should like to ask you, if possible, if you
mean to lock me up somewhere, to be so good as to do it
quickly and let me rest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> Excuse me, we must keep the rules.
Only a few questions. What do you feel? What are
you suffering from?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Nothing. I am perfectly well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> Yes, but you are not behaving like other
people.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> I am behaving as my conscience demands.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> Well, you see you have refused to perform
your military service. On what grounds do you
do so?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> I am a Christian, and therefore cannot commit
murder.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> But one must defend one's country from
her foes, and keep those who want to destroy the social
order from evil-doing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> No one is attacking our country; and there are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393">393</a></span>more among the governors who destroy social order,
than there are among those whom they oppress.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> Yes? But what do you mean by
that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> I mean this: the chief cause of evil&mdash;v&oacute;dka&mdash;is
sold by the Government; false and fraudulent religion is
also fostered by the Government; and this military service
which they demand of me&mdash;and which is the chief means
of demoralising the people&mdash;is also demanded by the
Government.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> Then, in your opinion, Government and
the State are unnecessary.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> That I don't know; but I know for certain that
I must take no part in evil-doing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> But what is to become of the world? Is
not our reason given in order to enable us to look ahead.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> It is also given in order to enable us to see that
social order should not be maintained by violence, but by
goodness; and that one man's refusal to participate in
evil cannot be at all dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> Well now, allow me to examine you a
bit. Will you have the goodness to lie down? [<i>Begins
touching him</i>] You feel no pain here?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> Nor here?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> Take a deep breath, please. Now don't
breathe. Now allow me [<i>takes out a measure and measures
forehead and nose</i>]. Now be so good as to shut your eyes
and walk.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Are you not ashamed to do all this?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> All this nonsense? You know that I am quite
well and that I am sent here because I refuse to take
part in their evil deeds, and because they have no answer
to give to the truth I told them; and that is why they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394">394</a></span>pretend to think me mad. And you co-operate with
them. It is horrid and it is shameful. Don't do it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> Then you don't wish to walk?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> No, I don't. You may torture me, but you must
do it yourself; I won't help you. [<i>Hotly</i>] Let me alone!
[<i>The Doctor presses button of bell. Enter two Warders</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> Don't get excited. I quite understand
that your nerves are strained. Will you please go to
your ward?</p>

<p><i>Enter Assistant Doctor.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ASSISTANT DOCTOR.</span> Some visitors have just come to see
Cheremsh&aacute;nov.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Who are they?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ASSISTANT DOCTOR.</span> Sar&yacute;ntsov and his daughter.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> I should like to see them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> There is no reason why you shouldn't.
Ask them in. You may see them here. [<i>Exit, followed
by Assistant and Warders</i>].</p>

<p><i>Enter Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich and Ly&uacute;ba. The Princess looks
in at the door and says, &ldquo;<span style="font-style: normal;">Go in, I'll come later.</span>&rdquo;</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA</span> [<i>goes straight to Bor&iacute;s, takes his head in her hands
and kisses him</i>] Poor Bor&iacute;s.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> No, don't pity me. I feel so well, so joyful, so
light. How d'you do. [<i>Kisses Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I have come to say chiefly one
thing to you. First of all, in such affairs it is worse to
overdo it than not to do enough. And in this matter
you should do as is said in the Gospels, and not think
beforehand, &ldquo;I shall say this, or do that&rdquo;: &ldquo;When they
deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall
speak: for it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your
Father who speaketh in you.&rdquo; That is to say, do not act
because you have reasoned out beforehand that you should
do so and so, but act only when your whole being feels
that you cannot act otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> I have done so. I did not think I should refuse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395">395</a></span>to serve; but when I saw all this fraud, those Mirrors of
Justice, those Documents, the Police and Officers smoking,
I could not help saying what I did. I was frightened,
but only till I had begun, after that it was all so simple
and joyful.</p>

<p><i>Ly&uacute;ba sits down and cries.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Above all, do nothing for the sake
of being praised, or to gain the approval of those whose
opinion you value. For myself I can say definitely, that
if you take the oath at once, and enter the service, I shall
love and esteem you not less but more than before;
because not the things that take place in the external
world are valuable, but that which goes on within the
soul.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Of course, for what happens within the soul must
make a change in the outside world.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Well, I have said my say. Your
mother is here. She is terribly upset. If you can do
what she asks, do it&mdash;that is what I wished to say to
you.</p>

<p><i>From the corridor outside hysterical weeping is heard. A
Lunatic rushes in, followed by Warders who drag him out again.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> How terrible! And you will be kept here?
[<i>Weeps</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> I am not afraid of it, I'm afraid of nothing
now! I feel so happy, the only thing I fear is what you
feel about it. Do help me; I am sure you will!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> Can I be glad about it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Not glad, that is impossible. I
myself am not glad. I suffer on his account and would
gladly take his place, but though I suffer I yet know
that it is well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> It may be well; but when will they set him
free?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> No one knows. I do not think of the future.
The present is so good, and you can make it still better.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396">396</a></span>
<i>Enter the Princess, his mother.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> I can wait no longer! [<i>To Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich</i>]
Well, have you persuaded him? Does he agree? B&oacute;rya,
my darling, you understand, don't you, what I suffer?
For thirty years I have lived but for you; rearing you,
rejoicing in you. And now when everything has been
done and is complete&mdash;you suddenly renounce everything.
Prison and disgrace! Oh no! B&oacute;rya!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Mamma! Listen to me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS</span> [<i>to Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich</i>] Why do you say
nothing? You have ruined him, it is for you to persuade
him. It's all very well for you! Ly&uacute;ba, do speak to him!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> I cannot!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Mamma, do understand that there are things that
are as impossible as flying; and I cannot serve in the army.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> You think that you can't! Nonsense.
Everybody has served and does serve. You and Nicholas
Iv&aacute;novich have invented some new sort of Christianity
which is not Christianity, but a devilish doctrine to make
everybody suffer!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> As is said in the Gospels!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> Nothing of the kind, or if it is, then all the
same it is stupid. Darling, B&oacute;rya, have pity on me.
[<i>Throws herself on his neck, weeps</i>] My whole life has
been nothing but sorrow. There was but one ray of
joy, and you are turning it into torture. B&oacute;rya&mdash;have
pity on me!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Mamma, this is terribly hard on me. But I
cannot explain it to you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> Come now, don't refuse&mdash;say you will serve!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Say you will think it over&mdash;and do
think it over.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S.</span> Very well then. But you too, Mamma, should
have pity on me. It is hard on me too. [<i>Cries are again
heard from the corridor</i>]. You know I'm in a lunatic
asylum, and might really go mad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397">397</a></span>
<i>Enter Head Doctor.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">HEAD DOCTOR.</span> Madam, this may have very bad consequences.
Your son is in a highly excited condition. I
think we must put an end to this interview. You may
call on visiting days&mdash;Thursdays and Sundays. Please
come to see him before twelve o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> Very well, very well, I will go. B&oacute;rya, good-bye!
Think it over. Have pity on me and meet me
next Thursday with good news!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>shaking hands with Bor&iacute;s</i>] Think it
over with God's help, and as if you knew you were to die
to-morrow. Only so will you decide rightly. Good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S</span> [<i>approaching Ly&uacute;ba</i>] And what do you say to me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> I cannot lie; and I do not understand why you
should torment yourself and everybody. I do not understand&mdash;and
can say nothing. [<i>Goes out weeping. Exeunt
all except Bor&iacute;s</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">BOR&Iacute;S</span> [<i>alone</i>] Oh how hard it is! Oh, how hard, Lord
help me! [<i>Prays</i>].</p>

<h3 class="smcap">Scene 1</h3>

<p class="scene">In Moscow a year later. A drawing-room in the Sar&yacute;ntsov's
town house is prepared for a dance. Footmen are arranging
plants round the grand piano. Enter Mary Iv&aacute;novna in an
elegant silk dress, with Alex&aacute;ndra Iv&aacute;novna.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> A ball? No, Only a dance! A
&ldquo;Juvenile Party&rdquo; as they once used to say. My children
took part in the Theatricals at the M&aacute;kofs, and have
been asked to dances everywhere, so I must return the
invitations.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I am afraid Nicholas does not
like it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I can't help it. [<i>To Footmen</i>] Put it
here! [<i>To Alex&aacute;ndra Iv&aacute;novna</i>] God knows how glad I
should be not to cause him unpleasantness. But I think
he has become much less exacting.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> No, no! Only he does not show
it so much. I saw how upset he was when he went off
to his own room after dinner.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> What can I do? After all, people
must live. We have seven children, and if they find no
amusement at home, heaven knows what they may be up
to. Anyhow I am quite happy about Ly&uacute;ba now.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Has he proposed, then?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> As good as proposed. He has spoken
to her, and she has said, Yes!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> That again will be a terrible
blow to Nicholas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399">399</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Oh, he knows. He can't help knowing.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> He does not like him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA</span> [<i>to the Footmen</i>] Put the fruit on the
side-board. Like whom? Alexander Mik&aacute;ylovich? Of
course not; because he is a living negation of all
Nicholas's pet theories. A nice pleasant kindly man of
the world. But oh! That terrible night-mare&mdash;that affair
of Bor&iacute;s Cheremsh&aacute;nov's. What has happened to him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Lisa has been to see him. He is
still there. She says he has grown terribly thin, and the
Doctors fear for his life or his reason.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Yes, he is one of the terrible sacrifices
caused by Nicholas's ideas. Why need he have been
ruined? I never wished it.</p>

<p><i>Enter Pianist.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA</span> [<i>to Pianist</i>] Have you come to play?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PIANIST.</span> Yes, I am the pianist.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Please take a seat and wait a little.
Won't you have a cup of tea?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PIANIST</span> [<i>goes to piano</i>] No, thank you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I never wished it. I liked B&oacute;rya, but
still he was not a suitable match for Ly&uacute;ba&mdash;especially after
he let himself be carried away by Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich's ideas.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEX&Aacute;NDRA IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But still, the strength of his convictions
is astonishing. See what he endures! They
tell him that as long as he persists in refusing to serve,
he will either remain where he is or be sent to the
fortress; but his reply is always the same. And yet
Lisa says he is full of joy and even merry!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Fanatic! But here comes Alexander
Mik&aacute;ylovich!</p>

<p><i>Enter Alexander Mik&aacute;ylovich Stark&oacute;vsky,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> an elegant man in

to dance a great deal so as to make up for the time she
has lost, and I have undertaken to help her.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> She is sorting favours for the cotillion.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STARK&Oacute;VSKY.</span> I will go and help her, if I may?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Certainly.</p>

<p><i>As Stark&oacute;vsky is going out he meets Ly&uacute;ba in evening, but
not low-necked, dress carrying a cushion with stars and
ribbons.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> Ah! here you are. Good! Now you can help
me. There are three more cushions in the drawing-room.

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Now, Ly&uacute;ba; friends are coming, and
they will be sure to hint and ask questions. May we
announce it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> No, Mamma, no. Why? Let them ask! Papa
will not like it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But he knows or guesses; and he will
have to be told sooner or later. I think it would be

whole evening. No, no, you must not.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Well, as you please.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> All right then: after the dance, just before
supper.</p>

<p><i>Enter Stark&oacute;vsky.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> Well, have you got them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401">401</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I'll go and have a look at the little

<p><span class="speaker">STARK&Oacute;VSKY</span> [<i>carrying three cushions, which he steadies with
his chin, and dropping things on the way</i>] Don't trouble,

prepared a lot of favours. If only I can manage to lead
the dance properly! V&aacute;nya, come along.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">V&Aacute;NYA</span> [<i>bringing more favours</i>] This is the whole lot.
Ly&uacute;ba, Alexander Mik&aacute;ylovich and I have a bet on, which
of us will win the most favours.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STARK&Oacute;VSKY.</span> It will be easy for you, for you know everybody
here, and will gain them easily, while I shall have to
charm the young ladies first before winning anything. It
means that I am giving you a start of forty points.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">V&Aacute;NYA.</span> But then you are a fianc&eacute;, and I am a

<p><span class="speaker">STARK&Oacute;VSKY.</span> Well no, I am not a fianc&eacute; yet, and I am
worse than a boy.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> V&aacute;nya, please go to my room and fetch the gum
and the pin-cushion from the what-not. Only for goodness'
sake don't break anything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">V&Aacute;NYA.</span> I'll break everything! [<i>Runs off</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STARK&Oacute;VSKY</span> [<i>takes Ly&uacute;ba's hand</i>] Ly&uacute;ba, may I? I am so
happy. [<i>Kisses her hand</i>] The mazurka is mine, but that
is not enough. One can't say much in a mazurka, and I
must speak. May I wire to my people that I have been
accepted and am happy?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> Yes, to-night.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STARK&Oacute;VSKY.</span> One word more: how will Nicholas
Iv&aacute;novich take it? Have you told him? Yes?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> No, I haven't; but I will. He will take it as
he now takes everything that concerns the family. He
will say, &ldquo;Do as you think best.&rdquo; But he will be grieved
at heart.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STARK&Oacute;VSKY.</span> Because I am not Cheremsh&aacute;nov? Because
I am a Mar&eacute;chal de la Noblesse?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402">402</a></span>
<span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> Yes. But I have struggled with myself and
deceived myself for his sake; and it is not because I love
him less that I am now doing not what he wants, but it is
because I can't lie. He himself says so. I do so want
to <em>live</em>!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STARK&Oacute;VSKY.</span> And life is the only truth! Well, and
what of Cheremsh&aacute;nov?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA</span> [<i>excitedly</i>] Don't speak of him to me! I wish to
blame him, to blame him whilst he is suffering; and I
know it is because I feel guilty towards him. All I know
is that I feel there is a kind of love&mdash;and I think a more
real love than I ever felt for him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STARK&Oacute;VSKY.</span> Ly&uacute;ba, is that true?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA.</span> You wish me to say that I love you with that
real love&mdash;but I won't say it. I do love you with a
different kind of love; but it is not the real thing either!
Neither the one nor the other is the real thing&mdash;if only
they could be mixed together!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STARK&Oacute;VSKY.</span> No, no, I am satisfied with mine. [<i>Kisses
her hand</i>] Ly&uacute;ba!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LY&Uacute;BA</span> [<i>pushes him away</i>] No, let us sort these things.
They are beginning to arrive.</p>

<p><i>Enter Princess with T&oacute;nya and a little girl.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> Are we the first?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">STARK&Oacute;VSKY.</span> Some one must be! I have suggested
making a gutta-percha dummy to be the first arrival!</p>

<p><i>Enter Sty&oacute;pa, also V&aacute;nya carrying the gum and pin-cushion.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">STY&Oacute;PA.</span> I expected to see you at the Italian opera last

<h3 class="smcap">Scene 2</h3>

<p class="scene">Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich's room. The dance music is heard in
the distance. Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich has an overcoat on. He
puts a letter on the table. Alexander Petr&oacute;vich, dressed in
ragged clothes, is with him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEXANDER PETR&Oacute;VICH.</span> Don't worry, we can reach the
Caucasus without spending a penny, and there you can
settle down.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> We will go by rail as far as T&uacute;la,
and from thence on foot. Well, I'm ready. [<i>Puts letter
in the middle of the table, and goes to the door, where he
meets Mary Iv&aacute;novna</i>] Oh! Why have you come here?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Why indeed? To prevent your doing
a cruel thing. What's all this for? Why d'you do it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Why? Because I cannot continue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404">404</a></span>living like this. I cannot endure this terrible, depraved
life.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> It is awful. My life&mdash;which I give
wholly to you and the children&mdash;has all of a sudden
become &ldquo;depraved.&rdquo; [<i>Sees Alexander Petr&oacute;vich</i>] <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Renvoyez
au moins cet homme. Je ne veux pas qu'il soit t&eacute;moin de cette
conversation.</i><a name="FNanchor_39_39" href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><span class="speaker">ALEXANDER PETR&Oacute;VICH.</span> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comprenez. Toujours moi partez.</i><a name="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Wait for me out there, Alexander
Petr&oacute;vich, I'll come in a minute.</p>

<p><i>Exit Alexander Petr&oacute;vich.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> And what can you have in common
with such a man as that? Why is he nearer to you than
your own wife? It is incomprehensible! And where
are you going?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I have left a letter for you. I did
not want to speak; it is too hard; but if you wish it, I
will try to say it quietly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> No, I don't understand. Why do you
hate and torture your wife, who has given up everything
for you? Tell me, have I been going to balls, or gone
in for dress, or flirted? My whole life has been devoted
to the family. I nursed them all myself; I brought them
up, and this last year the whole weight of their education,
and the managing our affairs, has fallen on me.&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>interrupting</i>] But all this weight
falls on you, because you do not wish to live as I proposed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But that was impossible! Ask anyone!
It was impossible to let the children grow up illiterate,
as you wished them to do, and for me to do the washing
and cooking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405">405</a></span>
<span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I never wanted that!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Well, anyhow it was something of that
kind! No, you are a Christian, you wish to do good,
and you say you love men; then why do you torture the
woman who has devoted her whole life to you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> How do I torture you? I love
you, but&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But is it not torturing me to leave me
and to go away? What will everybody say? One of two
things, either that I am a bad woman, or that you are
mad.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Well, let us say I am mad; but
I can't live like this.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But what is there so terrible in it,
even if once in a winter (and only once, because I feared
you would not like it) I do give a party&mdash;and even then
a very simple one, only ask M&aacute;nya and Barbara Vas&iacute;lyevna!
Everybody said I could not do less&mdash;and that it was
absolutely necessary. And now it seems even a crime,
for which I shall have to suffer disgrace. And not only
disgrace. The worst of all is that you no longer love
me! You love everyone else&mdash;the whole world, including
that drunken Alexander Petr&oacute;vich&mdash;but I still love
you and cannot live without you. Why do you do it?
Why? [<i>Weeps</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> But you don't even wish to understand
my life; my spiritual life.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> I do wish to understand it, but I can't.
I see that your Christianity has made you hate your
family and hate me; but I don't understand why!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> You see the others do understand!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Who? Alexander Petr&oacute;vich, who gets
money out of you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> He and others: T&oacute;nya and Vas&iacute;ly
Nikon&oacute;rovich. But even if nobody understood it, that
would make no difference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406">406</a></span>
<span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Vas&iacute;ly Nikon&oacute;rovich has repented, and
has got his living back, and T&oacute;nya is at this very moment
dancing and flirting with Sty&oacute;pa.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> I am sorry to hear it, but it does not
turn black into white, and it cannot change my life.
Mary! You do not need me. Let me go! I have tried
to share your life and to bring into it what for me
constitutes the whole of life; but it is impossible. It
only results in torturing myself and you. I not only
torment myself, but spoil the work I try to accomplish.
Everybody, including that very Alexander Petr&oacute;vich, has
the right to tell me that I am a hypocrite; that I talk
but do not act! That I preach the Gospel of poverty
while I live in luxury, pretending that I have given up
everything to my wife!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> So you are ashamed of what people
say? Really, can't you rise above that?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> It's not that I am ashamed (though
I am ashamed), but that I am spoiling God's work.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> You yourself often say that it fulfils
itself despite man's opposition; but that's not the point.
Tell me, what do you want of me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Haven't I told you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But, Nicholas, you know that that is
impossible. Only think, Ly&uacute;ba is now getting married;
V&aacute;nya is entering the university; Missy and K&aacute;tya are
studying. How can I break all that off?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Then what am I to do?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Do as you say one should do: have
patience, love. Is it too hard for you? Only bear with
us and do not take yourself from us! Come, what is it
that torments you?</p>

<p><i>Enter V&aacute;nya running.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">V&Aacute;NYA.</span> Mamma, they are calling you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Tell them I can't come. Go, go!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">V&Aacute;NYA.</span> Do come! [<i>He runs off</i>].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407">407</a></span>
<span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> You don't wish to see eye to eye&mdash;nor
to understand me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> It is not that I don't wish to, but that
I can't.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> No, you don't wish to, and we
drift further and further apart. Only enter into my
feelings; put yourself for a moment in my place, and you
will understand. First, the whole life here is thoroughly
depraved. You are vexed with the expression, but I can
give no other name to a life built wholly on robbery; for
the money you live on is taken from the land you have
stolen from the peasants. Moreover, I see that this life
is demoralising the children: &ldquo;Whoso shall cause one of
these little ones to stumble,&rdquo; and I see how they are
perishing and becoming depraved before my very eyes.
I cannot bear it when grown-up men dressed up in
swallow-tail coats serve us as if they were slaves. Every
dinner we have is a torture to me.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> But all this was so before. Is it not
done by everyone&mdash;both here and abroad?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> But <em>I</em> can't do it. Since I realised
that we are all brothers, I cannot see it without suffering.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> That is as you please. One can invent
anything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>hotly</i>] It's just this want of understanding
that is so terrible. Take for instance to-day!
I spent this morning at Rzh&aacute;nov's lodging-house, among
the outcasts there; and I saw an infant literally die of
hunger; a boy suffering from alcoholism; and a consumptive
charwoman rinsing clothes outside in the cold.
Then I returned home, and a footman with a white tie
opens the door for me. I see my son&mdash;a mere lad&mdash;ordering
that footman to fetch him some water; and I
see the army of servants who work for us. Then I go to
visit Bor&iacute;s&mdash;a man who is sacrificing his life for truth's sake.
I see how he, a pure, strong, resolute man, is deliberately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408">408</a></span>being goaded to lunacy and to destruction, that the Government
may be rid of him! I know, and they know, that
his heart is weak, and so they provoke him, and drag him
to a ward for raving lunatics. It is too dreadful, too
dreadful. And when I come home, I hear that the one
member of our family who understood&mdash;not me but the
truth&mdash;has thrown over both her betrothed to whom
she had promised her love, and the truth, and is going to
marry a lackey, a liar&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> How very Christian!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Yes, it is wrong of me, and I am to
blame, but I only want you to put yourself in my place.
I mean to say that she has turned from the truth&nbsp;&hellip;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> You say, &ldquo;from the truth&rdquo;; but other
people&mdash;the majority&mdash;say from &ldquo;an error.&rdquo; You see
Vas&iacute;ly Nikon&oacute;rovich once thought he was in error, but
now has come back to the Church.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> That's <span class="nowrap">impossible&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> He has written to Lisa! She will show
you the letter. That sort of conversion is very unstable.
So also in T&oacute;nya's case; I won't even speak of that
fellow Alexander Petr&oacute;vich, who simply considers it
profitable!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>getting angry</i>] Well, no matter. I
only ask <em>you</em> to understand me. I still consider that
truth is truth! All this hurts me very much. And here
at home I see a Christmas-tree, a ball, and hundreds of
roubles being spent while men are dying of hunger. I
cannot live so. Have pity on me, I am worried to death.
Let me go! Good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> If you go, I will go with you. Or if not
with you, I will throw myself under the train you leave
by; and let them all go to perdition&mdash;and Missy and K&aacute;tya
too. Oh my God, my God. What torture! Why?
What for? [<i>Weeps</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>at the door</i>] Alexander Petr&oacute;vich,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409">409</a></span>go home! I am not going. [<i>To his wife</i>] Very well, I
will stay. [<i>Takes off his overcoat</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA</span> [<i>embracing him</i>] We have not much
longer to live. Don't let us spoil everything after
twenty-eight years of life together. Well, I'll give no
more parties; but do not punish me so.</p>

<p><i>Enter V&aacute;nya and K&aacute;tya running.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">V&Aacute;NYA</span> and <span class="speaker">KATYA</span>. Mamma, be quick&mdash;come.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">MARY IV&Aacute;NOVNA.</span> Coming, coming. So let us forgive
one another! [<i>Exit with K&aacute;tya and V&aacute;nya</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> A child, a regular child; or a cunning
woman? No, a cunning child. Yes, yes. It seems Thou
dost not wish me to be Thy servant in this Thy work.
Thou wishest me to be humiliated, so that everyone may
point his finger at me and say, &ldquo;He preaches, but he does
not perform.&rdquo; Well, let them! Thou knowest best
what Thou requirest: submission, humility! Ah, if I
could but rise to that height!</p>

<p><i>Enter Lisa.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> Excuse me. I have brought you a letter from
Vas&iacute;ly Nikon&oacute;rovich. It is addressed to me, but he asks
me to tell you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Can it be really true?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> Yes. Shall I read it?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Please do.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA</span> [<i>reading</i>] &ldquo;I write to beg you to communicate this
to Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich. I greatly regret the error which
led me openly to stray from the Holy Orthodox Church,
to which I rejoice to have now returned. I hope you and
Nicholas Iv&aacute;novich will follow the same path. Please
forgive me!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> They have tortured him into this,
poor fellow. But still it is terrible.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> I also came to tell you that the Princess is here.
She came upstairs to me in a dreadfully excited state
and is determined to see you. She has just been to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410">410</a></span>Bor&iacute;s. I think you had better not see her. What good
can it do for her to see you?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> No. Call her in. Evidently this
is fated to be a day of dreadful torture.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">LISA.</span> Then I'll go and call her. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH</span> [<i>alone</i>] Yes&mdash;could I but remember
that life consists only in serving Thee; and that if Thou
sendest a trial, it is because Thou holdest me capable of
enduring it, and knowest that my strength is equal to it:
else it would not be a trial.&hellip; Father, help me&mdash;help
me to do Thy will.</p>

<p><i>Enter Princess.</i></p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> You receive me? You do me that honour?
My respects to you. I don't give you my hand, for I hate
you and despise you.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> What has happened?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> Just this, that they are moving him to the
Disciplinary Battalion; and it is you who are the cause
of it.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Princess, if you want anything,
tell me what it is; but if you have come here merely to
abuse me, you only injure yourself. You cannot offend
me, for with my whole heart I sympathise with you and
pity you!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> What charity! What exalted Christianity!
No, Mr. Sar&yacute;ntsov, you cannot deceive me! We know
you now. You have ruined my son, but you don't care;
and you go giving balls; and your daughter&mdash;my son's
betrothed&mdash;is to be married and make a good match, that
you approve of; while you pretend to lead a simple life,
and go carpentering. How repulsive you are to me,
with your new-fangled Pharisaism.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Don't excite yourself so, Princess.
Tell me what you have come for&mdash;surely it was not
simply to scold me?</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> Yes, that too! I must find vent for all this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411">411</a></span>accumulated pain. But what I want is this: He is
being removed to the Disciplinary Battalion, and I
cannot bear it. It is you who have done it. You!
You! You!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Not I, but God. And God knows
how sorry I am for you. Do not resist this will. He
wants to test you. Bear the trial meekly.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> I cannot bear it meekly. My whole life was
wrapped up in my son; and you have taken him from
me and ruined him. I cannot be calm. I have come to
you&mdash;it is my last attempt to tell you that you have
ruined him and that it is for you to save him. Go and
prevail on them to set him free. Go and see the
Governor-General, the Emperor, or whom you please.
It is your duty to do it. If you don't do it, I know what
I shall do. You will have to answer to me for it!</p>

<p><span class="speaker">NICHOLAS IV&Aacute;NOVICH.</span> Teach me what to do. I am
ready to do anything.</p>

<p><span class="speaker">PRINCESS.</span> I again repeat it&mdash;you must save him! If
you do not&mdash;beware! Good-bye. [<i>Exit</i>].</p>

have done right. I have accomplished nothing. Bor&iacute;s
has perished, Vas&iacute;ly Nikon&oacute;rovich has recanted. I set
an example of weakness. Evidently God does not wish
me to be his servant. He has many other servants&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413">413</a></span>can accomplish his will without me, and he who realises
this is at peace.&rdquo; Exit Lisa. He prays. The Princess
rushes in and shoots him. Everybody comes running into
the room. He says he did it himself by accident. He
writes a petition to the Emperor. Enter Vas&iacute;ly Nikon&oacute;rovich
with Doukhobors.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Dies rejoicing that the fraud
of the Church is exposed, and that he has understood the
meaning of his life.</p>
